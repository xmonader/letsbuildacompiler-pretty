<a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction"><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></a>
<p>In  the  first  four  installments  of  this  series, we've  been
concentrating on the parsing of math  expressions  and assignment
statements.  In  this  installment,  we'll  take off on a new and
exciting  tangent:  that   of  parsing  and  translating  control
constructs such as IF statements.</p>
<p>This subject is dear to my heart, because it represents a turning
point  for  me.    I  had  been  playing  with  the   parsing  of
expressions, just as  we  have  done  in this series, but I still
felt that I was a LONG way from being able  to  handle a complete
language.  After all, REAL  languages have branches and loops and
subroutines and all that.  Perhaps you've shared some of the same
thoughts.    Awhile  back,  though,  I  had  to  produce  control
constructs for a structured assembler preprocessor I was writing.
Imagine my surprise to  discover  that it was far easier than the
expression  parsing  I  had  already  been through.   I  remember
thinking, &quot;Hey! This is EASY!&quot; After we've finished this session,
I'll bet you'll be thinking so, too.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-plan" id="the-plan"><h2>THE PLAN</h2></a>
<p>In what follows, we'll be starting over again with a bare cradle,
and as we've done twice before now, we'll build things up  one at
a time.  We'll also  be retaining the concept of single-character
tokens that has served us so well to date.   This  means that the
&quot;code&quot; will look a little funny, with 'i' for IF, 'w'  for WHILE,
etc.  But it helps us  get  the concepts down pat without fussing
over  lexical  scanning.    Fear  not  ...  eventually we'll  see
something looking like &quot;real&quot; code.</p>
<p>I also don't  want  to  have  us  get bogged down in dealing with
statements other than branches, such as the assignment statements
we've  been  working  on.  We've already demonstrated that we can
handle them, so there's no point carrying them  around  as excess
baggage during this exercise.  So what I'll do instead is  to use
an  anonymous  statement,  &quot;other&quot;, to take the place of the non-
control statements and serve as a place-holder for them.  We have
to generate some kind of object code for them  (we're  back  into
compiling, not interpretation), so for want of anything else I'll
just echo the character input.</p>
<p>OK, then, starting with  yet  another  copy  of the cradle, let's
define the procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate an &quot;Other&quot; }

procedure Other;
begin
   EmitLn(GetName);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now include a call to it in the main program, thus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }

begin
   Init;
   Other;
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Run  the program and see what you get.  Not very exciting, is it?
But hang in there, it's a start, and things will get better.</p>
<p>The first thing we need is the ability to deal with more than one
statement, since a single-line branch  is pretty limited.  We did
that in the last session on interpreting, but this time let's get
a little more formal.  Consider the following BNF:</p>
<pre><code>          &lt;program&gt; ::= &lt;block&gt; END

          &lt;block&gt; ::= [ &lt;statement&gt; ]*
</code></pre>
<p>This says that, for our purposes here, a program is defined  as a
block, followed by an END statement.  A block, in  turn, consists
of zero or more statements.  We only have one kind  of statement,
so far.</p>
<p>What signals the end of a block?  It's  simply any construct that
isn't an &quot;other&quot;  statement.    For  now, that means only the END
statement.</p>
<p>Armed with these ideas, we can proceed to build  up  our  parser.
The code for a program (we  have  to call it DoProgram, or Pascal
will complain, is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Program }

procedure DoProgram;
begin
   Block;
   if Look &lt;&gt; 'e' then Expected('End');
   EmitLn('END')
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice  that  I've  arranged to emit  an  &quot;END&quot;  command  to  the
assembler, which sort of  punctuates  the  output code, and makes
sense considering that we're parsing a complete program here.</p>
<p>The code for Block is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Statement Block }

procedure Block;
begin
   while not(Look in ['e']) do begin
      Other;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(From the form of the procedure, you just KNOW we're going  to be
adding to it in a bit!)</p>
<p>OK, enter these routines into your program.  Replace the  call to
Block in the main program, by  a  call  to DoProgram.  Now try it
and  see  how  it works.  Well, it's still not  much,  but  we're
getting closer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#some-groundwork" id="some-groundwork"><h2>SOME GROUNDWORK</h2></a>
<p>Before we begin to define the various control constructs, we need
to  lay a bit more groundwork.  First, a word of warning: I won't
be using the same syntax  for these constructs as you're familiar
with  from Pascal or C.  For example, the Pascal syntax for an IF
is:</p>
<pre><code> `IF &lt;condition&gt; THEN &lt;statement&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>(where the statement, of course, may be compound).</p>
<p>The C version is similar:</p>
<pre><code> `IF ( &lt;condition&gt; ) &lt;statement&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, I'll be using something that looks more like Ada:</p>
<pre><code> `IF &lt;condition&gt; &lt;block&gt; ENDIF`
</code></pre>
<p>In  other  words,  the IF construct has  a  specific  termination
symbol.  This avoids  the  dangling-else of Pascal and C and also
precludes the need for the brackets {} or begin-end.   The syntax
I'm showing you here, in fact, is that of the language  KISS that
I'll be detailing in  later  installments.   The other constructs
will also be  slightly  different.    That  shouldn't  be  a real
problem for you.  Once you see how it's done, you'll realize that
it  really  doesn't  matter  so  much  which  specific syntax  is
involved.  Once the syntax is defined, turning it  into  code  is
straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, all of the  constructs  we'll  be  dealing with here involve
transfer of control, which at the assembler-language  level means
conditional  and/or  unconditional branches.   For  example,  the
simple IF statement</p>
<pre><code>      `IF &lt;condition&gt; A ENDIF B ....`
</code></pre>
<p>must get translated into</p>
<pre><code>          Branch if NOT condition to L
          A
     L:   B
          ...
</code></pre>
<p>It's clear, then, that we're going to need  some  more procedures
to  help  us  deal with these branches.  I've defined two of them
below.  Procedure NewLabel generates unique labels.  This is done
via the simple expedient of calling every label  'Lnn',  where nn
is a label number starting from zero.   Procedure  PostLabel just
outputs the labels at the proper place.</p>
<p>Here are the two routines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate a Unique Label }

function NewLabel: string;
var S: string;
begin
   Str(LCount, S);
   NewLabel := 'L' + S;
   Inc(LCount);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Post a Label To Output }

procedure PostLabel(L: string);
begin
   WriteLn(L, ':');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we've added  a  new  global  variable, LCount, so you
need to change the VAR declarations at the top of the  program to
look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">var Look  : char;              { Lookahead Character }
    Lcount: integer;           { Label Counter }
</code></pre>
<p>Also, add the following extra initialization to Init:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">   LCount := 0;
</code></pre>
<p>(DON'T forget that, or your labels can look really strange!)</p>
<p>At this point I'd also like to show you a  new  kind of notation.
If  you  compare  the form of the IF statement above with the as-
sembler code that must be produced, you can see  that  there  are
certain  actions  associated  with each of the  keywords  in  the
statement:</p>
<pre><code> - IF:  First, get the condition and issue the code for it.
      Then, create a unique label and emit a branch if false.

 - ENDIF: Emit the label.
</code></pre>
<p>These actions can be shown very concisely if we write  the syntax
this way:</p>
<pre><code>     IF
     &lt;condition&gt;    { Condition;
                      L = NewLabel;
                      Emit(Branch False to L); }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDIF          { PostLabel(L) }
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example  of  syntax-directed  translation.  We've been
doing it all along ... we've just never written it down  this way
before.  The stuff in curly brackets represents the ACTIONS to be
taken.  The nice part about this representation is  that  it  not
only shows what  we  have  to  recognize, but also the actions we
have to perform, and in which  order.   Once we have this syntax,
the code almost writes itself.</p>
<p>About  the  only thing left to do is to be a  bit  more  specific
about what we mean by &quot;Branch if false.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm assuming that there will  be  code  executed  for <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code>
that  will  perform  Boolean algebra and compute some result.  It
should also set the condition flags corresponding to that result.
Now, the usual convention  for  a Boolean variable is to let 0000
represent &quot;false,&quot; and  anything  else (some use FFFF, some 0001)
represent &quot;true.&quot;</p>
<p>On the 68000  the  condition  flags  are set whenever any data is
moved or calculated.  If the  data  is a 0000 (corresponding to a
false condition, remember), the zero flag will be set.   The code
for &quot;Branch on zero&quot; is BEQ.  So for our purposes here,</p>
<pre><code>               BEQ  &lt;=&gt; Branch if false
               BNE  &lt;=&gt; Branch if true
</code></pre>
<p>It's the nature of the beast that most  of  the  branches  we see
will  be  BEQ's  ...  we'll  be branching AROUND the code  that's
supposed to be executed when the condition is true.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-if-statement" id="the-if-statement"><h2>THE IF STATEMENT</h2></a>
<p>With that bit of explanation out of the way, we're  finally ready
to begin coding the IF-statement parser.  In  fact,  we've almost
already  done  it!   As usual, I'll be using our single-character
approach, with the character 'i' for IF, and 'e'  for  ENDIF  (as
well  as END ... that dual nature causes  no  confusion).    I'll
also, for now, skip completely  the character for the branch con-
dition, which we still have to define.</p>
<p>The code for DoIf is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate an IF Construct }

procedure Block; Forward;


procedure DoIf;
var L: string;
begin
   Match('i');
   L := NewLabel;
   Condition;
   EmitLn('BEQ ' + L);
   Block;
   Match('e');
   PostLabel(L);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Add this routine to your program, and change  Block  to reference
it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Statement Block }

procedure Block;
begin
   while not(Look in ['e']) do begin
      case Look of
       'i': DoIf;
       'o': Other;
      end;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the reference to procedure Condition.    Eventually, we'll
write a routine that  can  parse  and  translate any Boolean con-
dition we care to give it.  But  that's  a  whole  installment by
itself (the next one, in fact).    For  now, let's just make it a
dummy that emits some text.  Write the following routine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Boolean Condition }
{ This version is a dummy }

Procedure Condition;
begin
   EmitLn('&lt;condition&gt;');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Insert this procedure in your program just before DoIf.   Now run
the program.  Try a string like</p>
<pre><code> `aibece`
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see,  the  parser seems to recognize the construct and
inserts the object code at the  right  places.   Now try a set of
nested IF's, like</p>
<pre><code> `aibicedefe`
</code></pre>
<p>It's starting to look real, eh?</p>
<p>Now that we  have  the  general  idea  (and the tools such as the
notation and the procedures NewLabel and PostLabel), it's a piece
of cake to extend the parser to include other  constructs.    The
first (and also one of the  trickiest)  is to add the ELSE clause
to IF.  The BNF is</p>
<pre><code> `IF &lt;condition&gt; &lt;block&gt; [ ELSE &lt;block&gt;] ENDIF`
</code></pre>
<p>The tricky part arises simply  because there is an optional part,
which doesn't occur in the other constructs.</p>
<p>The corresponding output code should be</p>
<pre><code>          &lt;condition&gt;
          BEQ L1
          &lt;block&gt;
          BRA L2
     L1:  &lt;block&gt;
     L2:  ...
</code></pre>
<p>This leads us to the following syntax-directed translation:</p>
<pre><code>
     IF
     &lt;condition&gt;    { L1 = NewLabel;
                      L2 = NewLabel;
                      Emit(BEQ L1) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ELSE           { Emit(BRA L2);
                      PostLabel(L1) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDIF          { PostLabel(L2) }

</code></pre>
<p>Comparing this with the case for an ELSE-less IF gives us  a clue
as to how to handle both situations.   The  code  below  does it.
(Note that I  use  an  'l'  for  the ELSE, since 'e' is otherwise
occupied):</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate an IF Construct }

procedure DoIf;
var L1, L2: string;
begin
   Match('i');
   Condition;
   L1 := NewLabel;
   L2 := L1;
   EmitLn('BEQ ' + L1);
   Block;
   if Look = 'l' then begin
      Match('l');
      L2 := NewLabel;
      EmitLn('BRA ' + L2);
      PostLabel(L1);
      Block;
   end;
   Match('e');

</code></pre>
<p>There you have it.  A complete IF parser/translator, in  19 lines
of code.</p>
<p>Give it a try now.  Try something like</p>
<p><code>aiblcede</code></p>
<p>Did it work?  Now, just  to  be  sure we haven't broken the ELSE-
less case, try</p>
<p><code>aibece</code></p>
<p>Now try some nested IF's.  Try anything you like,  including some
badly formed statements.   Just  remember that 'e' is not a legal
&quot;other&quot; statement.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-while-statement" id="the-while-statement"><h2>THE WHILE STATEMENT</h2></a>
<p>The next type of statement should be easy, since we  already have
the process  down  pat.    The  syntax  I've chosen for the WHILE
statement is</p>
<pre><code>      `WHILE &lt;condition&gt; &lt;block&gt; ENDWHILE`
</code></pre>
<p>I know,  I  know,  we  don't  REALLY  need separate kinds of ter-
minators for each construct ... you can see that by the fact that
in our one-character version, 'e' is used for all of them.  But I
also remember  MANY debugging sessions in Pascal, trying to track
down a wayward END that the compiler obviously thought I meant to
put  somewhere  else.   It's been my experience that specific and
unique  keywords,  although  they add to the  vocabulary  of  the
language,  give  a  bit of error-checking that is worth the extra
work for the compiler writer.</p>
<p>Now,  consider  what  the  WHILE  should be translated into.   It
should be:</p>
<pre><code>     L1:  &lt;condition&gt;
          BEQ L2
          &lt;block&gt;
          BRA L1
     L2:
</code></pre>
<p>As before, comparing the two representations gives us the actions
needed at each point.</p>
<pre><code>     WHILE          { L1 = NewLabel;
                      PostLabel(L1) }
     &lt;condition&gt;    { Emit(BEQ L2) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDWHILE       { Emit(BRA L1);
                      PostLabel(L2) }
</code></pre>
<p>The code follows immediately from the syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a WHILE Statement }

procedure DoWhile;
var L1, L2: string;
begin
   Match('w');
   L1 := NewLabel;
   L2 := NewLabel;
   PostLabel(L1);
   Condition;
   EmitLn('BEQ ' + L2);
   Block;
   Match('e');
   EmitLn('BRA ' + L1);
   PostLabel(L2);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Since  we've  got a new statement, we have to add a  call  to  it
within procedure Block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Statement Block }

procedure Block;
begin
   while not(Look in ['e', 'l']) do begin
      case Look of
       'i': DoIf;
       'w': DoWhile;
       else Other;
      end;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>No other changes are necessary.</p>
<p>OK, try the new program.  Note that this  time,  the  <condition>
code is INSIDE the upper label, which is just where we wanted it.
Try some nested loops.  Try some loops within IF's, and some IF's
within loops.  If you get  a  bit  confused as to what you should
type, don't be discouraged:  you  write  bugs in other languages,
too, don't you?  It'll look a lot  more  meaningful  when  we get
full keywords.</p>
<p>I hope by now that you're beginning to  get  the  idea  that this
really  IS easy.  All we have to do to accomodate a new construct
is to work out  the  syntax-directed translation of it.  The code
almost falls out  from  there,  and  it doesn't affect any of the
other routines.  Once you've gotten the feel of the thing, you'll
see that you  can  add  new  constructs  about as fast as you can
dream them up.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-loop-statement" id="the-loop-statement"><h2>THE LOOP STATEMENT</h2></a>
<p>We could stop right here, and  have  a language that works.  It's
been  shown  many  times that a high-order language with only two
constructs, the IF and the WHILE, is sufficient  to  write struc-
tured  code.   But we're on a roll now, so let's  richen  up  the
repertoire a bit.</p>
<p>This construct is even easier, since it has no condition  test at
all  ... it's an infinite loop.  What's the point of such a loop?
Not much, by  itself,  but  later  on  we're going to add a BREAK
command,  that  will  give us a way out.  This makes the language
considerably richer than Pascal, which  has  no  break,  and also
avoids the funny  WHILE(1) or WHILE TRUE of C and Pascal.</p>
<p>The syntax is simply</p>
<pre><code> `LOOP &lt;block&gt; ENDLOOP`
</code></pre>
<p>and the syntax-directed translation is:</p>
<pre><code>     LOOP           { L = NewLabel;
                      PostLabel(L) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDLOOP        { Emit(BRA L }
</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding code is shown below.  Since  I've  already used
'l'  for  the  ELSE, I've used  the  last  letter,  'p',  as  the
&quot;keyword&quot; this time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a LOOP Statement }

procedure DoLoop;
var L: string;
begin
   Match('p');
   L := NewLabel;
   PostLabel(L);
   Block;
   Match('e');
   EmitLn('BRA ' + L);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>When you insert this routine, don't forget to add a line in Block
to call it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#repeat-until" id="repeat-until"><h2>REPEAT-UNTIL</h2></a>
<p>Here's one construct that I lifted right from Pascal.  The syntax
is</p>
<pre><code> `REPEAT &lt;block&gt; UNTIL &lt;condition&gt;`  ,
</code></pre>
<p>and the syntax-directed translation is:</p>
<pre><code>     REPEAT         { L = NewLabel;
                      PostLabel(L) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     UNTIL
     &lt;condition&gt;    { Emit(BEQ L) }
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, the code falls out pretty easily:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a REPEAT Statement }

procedure DoRepeat;
var L: string;
begin
   Match('r');
   L := NewLabel;
   PostLabel(L);
   Block;
   Match('u');
   Condition;
   EmitLn('BEQ ' + L);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>As  before, we have to add the call  to  DoRepeat  within  Block.
This time, there's a difference, though.  I decided  to  use  'r'
for REPEAT (naturally), but I also decided to use 'u'  for UNTIL.
This means that the 'u' must be added to the set of characters in
the while-test.  These  are  the  characters  that signal an exit
from the current  block  ... the &quot;follow&quot; characters, in compiler
jargon.</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Statement Block }

procedure Block;
begin
   while not(Look in ['e', 'l', 'u']) do begin
      case Look of
       'i': DoIf;
       'w': DoWhile;
       'p': DoLoop;
       'r': DoRepeat;
       else Other;

<a class="header" href="#the-for-loop" id="the-for-loop"><h2>THE FOR LOOP</h2></a>
<p>The FOR loop  is a very handy one to have around, but it's a bear
to translate.  That's not so much because the construct itself is
hard ... it's only a loop  after  all ... but simply because it's
hard to implement  in  assembler  language.    Once  the  code is
figured out, the translation is straightforward enough.</p>
<p>C fans love  the  FOR-loop  of  that language (and, in fact, it's
easier to code), but I've chosen instead a syntax very  much like
the one from good ol' BASIC:</p>
<pre><code>     FOR &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;expr1&gt; TO &lt;expr2&gt; &lt;block&gt; ENDFOR
</code></pre>
<p>The translation of a FOR loop  can  be just about as difficult as
you choose  to  make  it,  depending  upon  the way you decide to
define  the rules as to how to handle the limits.  Does expr2 get
evaluated  every time through the loop, for  example,  or  is  it
treated as a constant limit?   Do  you always go through the loop
at least once,  as  in  FORTRAN,  or  not? It gets simpler if you
adopt the point of view that the construct is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>     &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;expr1&gt;
     TEMP = &lt;expr2&gt;
     WHILE &lt;ident&gt; &lt;= TEMP
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDWHILE
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that with this definition of the loop, <code>&lt;block&gt;</code> will not be
executed at all if <code>&lt;expr1&gt;</code> is initially larger than <code>&lt;expr2&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The 68000 code needed to do this is trickier than  anything we've
done so far.  I had a couple  of  tries  at  it, putting both the
counter  and  the    upper limit on the stack, both in registers,
etc.  I  finally  arrived  at  a hybrid arrangement, in which the
loop counter is in memory (so that it can be accessed  within the
loop), and the upper limit is on the stack.  The  translated code
came out like this:</p>
<pre><code>          &lt;ident&gt;             get name of loop counter
          &lt;expr1&gt;             get initial value
          LEA &lt;ident&gt;(PC),A0  address the loop counter
          SUBQ #1,D0          predecrement it
          MOVE D0,(A0)        save it
          &lt;expr1&gt;             get upper limit
          MOVE D0,-(SP)       save it on stack

     L1:  LEA &lt;ident&gt;(PC),A0  address loop counter
          MOVE (A0),D0        fetch it to D0
          ADDQ #1,D0          bump the counter
          MOVE D0,(A0)        save new value
          CMP (SP),D0         check for range
          BLE L2              skip out if D0 &gt; (SP)
          &lt;block&gt;
          BRA L1              loop for next pass
     L2:  ADDQ #2,SP          clean up the stack
</code></pre>
<p>Wow!    That  seems like a lot of code ...  the  line  containing
<code>&lt;block&gt;</code> seems to almost get lost.  But that's the best I could do
with it.   I guess it helps to keep in mind that it's really only
sixteen  words,  after  all.  If  anyone else can  optimize  this
better, please let me know.</p>
<p>Still, the parser  routine  is  pretty  easy now that we have the
code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a FOR Statement }

procedure DoFor;
var L1, L2: string;
    Name: char;
begin
   Match('f');
   L1 := NewLabel;
   L2 := NewLabel;
   Name := GetName;
   Match('=');
   Expression;
   EmitLn('SUBQ #1,D0');
   EmitLn('LEA ' + Name + '(PC),A0');
   EmitLn('MOVE D0,(A0)');
   Expression;
   EmitLn('MOVE D0,-(SP)');
   PostLabel(L1);
   EmitLn('LEA ' + Name + '(PC),A0');
   EmitLn('MOVE (A0),D0');
   EmitLn('ADDQ #1,D0');
   EmitLn('MOVE D0,(A0)');
   EmitLn('CMP (SP),D0');
   EmitLn('BGT ' + L2);
   Block;
   Match('e');
   EmitLn('BRA ' + L1);
   PostLabel(L2);
   EmitLn('ADDQ #2,SP');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Since we don't have  expressions  in this parser, I used the same
trick as for Condition, and wrote the routine</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Expression }
{ This version is a dummy }

Procedure Expression;
begin
   EmitLn('&lt;expr&gt;');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Give it a try.  Once again,  don't  forget  to  add  the  call in
Block.    Since  we don't have any input for the dummy version of
Expression, a typical input line would look something like</p>
<pre><code> `afi=bece`
</code></pre>
<p>Well, it DOES generate a lot of code, doesn't it?    But at least
it's the RIGHT code.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-do-statement" id="the-do-statement"><h2>THE DO STATEMENT</h2></a>
<p>All this made me wish for a simpler version of the FOR loop.  The
reason for all the code  above  is  the  need  to  have  the loop
counter accessible as a variable within the loop.  If all we need
is a counting loop to make us go through  something  a  specified
number of times, but  don't  need  access  to the counter itself,
there is a much easier solution.  The 68000 has a  &quot;decrement and
branch nonzero&quot; instruction built in which is ideal for counting.
For good measure, let's add this construct, too.   This  will  be
the last of our loop structures.</p>
<p>The syntax and its translation is:</p>
<pre><code>     DO
     &lt;expr&gt;         { Emit(SUBQ #1,D0);
                      L = NewLabel;
                      PostLabel(L);
                      Emit(MOVE D0,-(SP) }
     &lt;block&gt;
     ENDDO          { Emit(MOVE (SP)+,D0;
                      Emit(DBRA D0,L) }

</code></pre>
<p>That's quite a bit simpler!  The loop will execute  <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> times.
Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a DO Statement }

procedure Dodo;
var L: string;
begin
   Match('d');
   L := NewLabel;
   Expression;
   EmitLn('SUBQ #1,D0');
   PostLabel(L);
   EmitLn('MOVE D0,-(SP)');
   Block;
   EmitLn('MOVE (SP)+,D0');
   EmitLn('DBRA D0,' + L);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>I think you'll have to agree, that's a whole lot simpler than the
classical FOR.  Still, each construct has its place.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-break-statement" id="the-break-statement"><h2>THE BREAK STATEMENT</h2></a>
<p>Earlier I promised you a BREAK statement to accompany LOOP.  This
is  one  I'm sort of proud of.  On the face of it a  BREAK  seems
really  tricky.  My first approach was to just use it as an extra
terminator to Block, and split all the loops into two parts, just
as  I did with the ELSE half of an IF.  That  turns  out  not  to
work, though, because the BREAK statement is almost certainly not
going to show  up at the same level as the loop itself.  The most
likely place for a BREAK is right after an IF, which  would cause
it to exit to the IF  construct,  not the enclosing loop.  WRONG.
The  BREAK  has  to exit the inner LOOP, even if it's nested down
into several levels of IFs.</p>
<p>My next thought was that I would just store away, in  some global
variable, the ending label of the innermost loop.    That doesn't
work  either, because there may be a break  from  an  inner  loop
followed by a break from an outer one.  Storing the label for the
inner loop would clobber the label for the  outer  one.    So the
global variable turned into a stack.  Things were starting to get
messy.</p>
<p>Then  I  decided  to take my own advice.  Remember  in  the  last
session when  I  pointed  out  how  well  the implicit stack of a
recursive descent parser was  serving  our needs?  I said that if
you begin to  see  the  need  for  an external stack you might be
doing  something  wrong.   Well, I was.  It is indeed possible to
let the recursion built into  our parser take care of everything,
and the solution is so simple that it's surprising.</p>
<p>The secret is  to  note  that  every BREAK statement has to occur
within a block ... there's no place else for it to be.  So all we
have  to  do  is to pass into  Block  the  exit  address  of  the
innermost loop.  Then it can pass the address to the routine that
translates the  break instruction.  Since an IF statement doesn't
change the loop level, procedure DoIf doesn't need to do anything
except  pass the label into ITS blocks (both  of  them).    Since
loops DO change the level,  each  loop  construct  simply ignores
whatever label is above it and passes its own exit label along.</p>
<p>All  this  is easier to show you than it is to  describe.    I'll
demonstrate with the easiest loop, which is LOOP:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a LOOP Statement }

procedure DoLoop;
var L1, L2: string;
begin
   Match('p');
   L1 := NewLabel;
   L2 := NewLabel;
   PostLabel(L1);
   Block(L2);
   Match('e');
   EmitLn('BRA ' + L1);
   PostLabel(L2);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that DoLoop now has TWO labels, not just one.   The second
is to give the BREAK instruction a target to jump  to.   If there
is no BREAK within  the  loop, we've wasted a label and cluttered
up things a bit, but there's no harm done.</p>
<p>Note also that Block now has a parameter, which  for  loops  will
always be the exit address.  The new version of Block is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Statement Block }

procedure Block(L: string);
begin
   while not(Look in ['e', 'l', 'u']) do begin
      case Look of
       'i': DoIf(L);
       'w': DoWhile;
       'p': DoLoop;
       'r': DoRepeat;
       'f': DoFor;
       'd': DoDo;
       'b': DoBreak(L);
       else Other;
      end;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Again,  notice  that  all Block does with the label is to pass it
into DoIf and  DoBreak.    The  loop  constructs  don't  need it,
because they are going to pass their own label anyway.</p>
<p>The new version of DoIf is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate an IF Construct }

procedure Block(L: string); Forward;


procedure DoIf(L: string);
var L1, L2: string;
begin
   Match('i');
   Condition;
   L1 := NewLabel;
   L2 := L1;
   EmitLn('BEQ ' + L1);
   Block(L);
   if Look = 'l' then begin
      Match('l');
      L2 := NewLabel;
      EmitLn('BRA ' + L2);
      PostLabel(L1);
      Block(L);
   end;
   Match('e');
   PostLabel(L2);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Here,  the  only  thing  that  changes  is  the addition  of  the
parameter to procedure Block.  An IF statement doesn't change the
loop  nesting level, so DoIf just passes the  label  along.    No
matter how many levels of IF nesting we have, the same label will
be used.</p>
<p>Now, remember that DoProgram also calls Block, so it now needs to
pass it a label.  An  attempt  to  exit the outermost block is an
error, so DoProgram  passes  a  null  label  which  is  caught by
DoBreak:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a BREAK }

procedure DoBreak(L: string);
begin
   Match('b');
   if L &lt;&gt; '' then
      EmitLn('BRA ' + L)
   else Abort('No loop to break from');
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}

{ Parse and Translate a Program }

procedure DoProgram;
begin
   Block('');
   if Look &lt;&gt; 'e' then Expected('End');
   EmitLn('END')
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>That  ALMOST takes care of everything.  Give it a try, see if you
can &quot;break&quot; it <code>&lt;pun&gt;</code>.  Careful, though.  By this time  we've used
so many letters, it's hard to think of characters that aren't now
representing  reserved  words.    Remember:  before  you  try the
program, you're going to have to edit every occurence of Block in
the other loop constructs to include the new parameter.    Do  it
just like I did for LOOP.</p>
<p>I  said ALMOST above.  There is one slight problem: if you take a
hard  look  at  the code generated for DO, you'll see that if you
break  out  of  this loop, the value of the loop counter is still
left on the stack.  We're going to have to fix that!  A shame ...
that was one  of  our  smaller  routines, but it can't be helped.
Here's a version that doesn't have the problem:</p>

<p>The  two  extra  instructions,  the  SUBQ and ADDQ, take care  of
leaving the stack in the right shape.</p>
<a class="header" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"><h2>CONCLUSION</h2></a>
<p>At this point we have created a number of control  constructs ...
a richer set, really, than that provided by almost any other pro-
gramming language.  And,  except  for the FOR loop, it was pretty
easy to do.  Even that one was tricky only because it's tricky in
assembler language.</p>
<p>I'll conclude this session here.  To wrap the thing up with a red
ribbon, we really  should  have  a  go  at  having  real keywords
instead of these mickey-mouse  single-character  things.   You've
already seen that  the  extension to multi-character words is not
difficult, but in this case it will make a big difference  in the
appearance of our input code.  I'll save that little bit  for the
next installment.  In that installment we'll also address Boolean
expressions, so we can get rid of the dummy version  of Condition
that we've used here.  See you then.</p>
<p>For reference purposes, here is  the  completed  parser  for this
session:</p>
