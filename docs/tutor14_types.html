<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In the  last installment (<a href="tutor13_procedures.html">Part XIII: PROCEDURES</a>) I mentioned that
in that part and this one,  we  would cover the two features that
tend  to  separate  the toy language from a real, usable one.  We
covered  procedure  calls  in that installment.  Many of you have
been  waiting patiently, since August ’89, for  me  to  drop  the
other shoe.  Well, here it is.</p>
<p>In this installment, we’ll talk  about how to deal with different
data types.  As I did in the last segment, I will <em>not</em> incorporate
these  features directly into the TINY  compiler  at  this  time.
Instead, I’ll be using the same approach that has worked  so well
for  us  in the past: using only  fragments  of  the  parser  and
single-character  tokens.    As  usual,  this  allows  us to  get
directly to the  heart  of  the  matter  without  having  to wade
through a lot of  unnecessary  code.  Since the major problems in
dealing with multiple types occur in  the  arithmetic operations,
that’s where we’ll concentrate our focus.</p>
<p>A  few words of warning:  First, there are some types that I will
NOT  be  covering in this installment.   Here  we  will  <em>only</em>  be
talking about the simple, predefined types.  We  won’t  even deal
with arrays, pointers or strings  in  this  installment;  I’ll be
covering them in the next few.</p>
<p>Second, we also will not discuss user-defined types.    That will
not come until  much  later,  for  the simple reason that I still
haven’t convinced myself  that  user-defined  types  belong  in a
language named KISS.  In later installments, I do intend to cover
at least the general  concepts  of  user-defined  types, records,
etc., just so that the series  will  be complete.  But whether or
not they will be included as part of KISS is still an open issue.
I am open to comments or suggestions on this question.</p>
<p>Finally,  I  should  warn you: what we are about to  do  <em>can</em>  add
considerable  extra  complication  to  both  the  parser  and the
generated  code.    Handling  variables  of  different  types  is
straightforward enough.  The complexity  comes  in  when  you add
rules about conversion between types.  In general,  you  can make
the  compiler  as  simple or as complex as you choose to make it,
depending upon the  way  you  define  the  type-conversion rules.
Even if you decide not to allow <em>any</em> type conversions (as  in Ada,
for example) the problem is still there, and is  built  into  the
mathematics.  When  you  multiply two short numbers, for example,
you can get a long result.</p>
<p>I’ve approached this problem very  carefully,  in  an  attempt to
Keep It Simple.  But we can’t avoid the complexity entirely.   As
has so often has happened, we end up having to trade code quality
against complexity,  and  as  usual  I  will  tend to opt for the
simplest approach.</p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-next"><a class="header" href="#whats-coming-next">What’s Coming Next?</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the tutorial, I think you’d like to know where
we are going  from  here  …  especially since it’s been so long
since the <a href="tutor13_procedures.html">last installment</a>.</p>
<p>I have not been idle in  the  meantime.   What I’ve been doing is
reorganizing  the  compiler  itself into Turbo Units.  One of the
problems I’ve encountered is that  as we’ve covered new areas and
thereby added features to  the  TINY  compiler, it’s been getting
longer and longer.  I realized a couple of installments back that
this was causing trouble, and that’s why I’ve gone back  to using
only compiler fragments for  the  last  installment and this one.
The problem is that it just  seems  dumb to have to reproduce the
code  for,  say,  processing  boolean  exclusive  ORs,  when the
subject of the discussion is parameter passing.</p>
<p>The obvious way  to have our cake and eat it, too, is to break up
the compiler into separately compilable  modules,  and  of course
the Turbo Unit is an ideal  vehicle  for doing this.  This allows
us to hide some fairly complex code (such as the  full arithmetic
and boolean expression parsing) into a single unit, and just pull
it in whenever it’s needed.  In that way, the only code I’ll have
to reproduce in these installments will be the code that actually
relates to the issue under discussion.</p>
<p>I’ve  also  been  toying with Turbo 5.5, which of course includes
the Borland object-oriented  extensions  to  Pascal.    I haven’t
decided whether to make use of these features,  for  two reasons.
First of all, many of you who have been following this series may
still not have 5.5, and I certainly don’t want to force anyone to
have to go out and  buy  a  new  compiler  just  to  complete the
series.  Secondly, I’m not convinced that the O-O extensions have
all that much value for this application.  We’ve been having some
discussions  about that in CompuServe’s CLM  forum,  and  so  far
we’ve  not found any compelling reason  to  use  O-O  constructs.
This is another of those areas where I could  use  some  feedback
from you readers.  Anyone want to vote for Turbo 5.5 and O-O?</p>
<p>In any case, after  the  next few installments in the series, the
plan  is  to  upload to you a complete set of Units, and complete
functioning compilers as  well.    The  plan, in fact, is to have
<em>three</em> compilers:  One for  a single-character version of TINY (to
use  for  our  experiments), one for TINY and one for KISS.  I’ve
pretty much isolated the differences between TINY and KISS, which
are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TINY will support only two data types: The character and the
16-bit  integer.    I may also  try  to  do  something  with
strings, since  without  them  a  compiler  would  be pretty
useless.   KISS will support all  the  usual  simple  types,
including arrays and even floating point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TINY will only have two control constructs, the  <code>IF</code>  and the
<code>WHILE</code>.  KISS will  support  a  very  rich set of constructs,
including one we haven’t discussed here before … the <code>CASE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KISS will support separately compilable modules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One caveat: Since I still don’t know much  about  80x86 assembler
language, all these compiler modules  will  still  be  written to
support 68000 code.  However, for the programs I plan  to upload,
all the code generation  has  been  carefully encapsulated into a
single unit, so that any enterprising student should  be  able to
easily retarget to any other processor.  This task is “left as an
exercise for the  student.”    I’ll  make an offer right here and
now:  For the person who provides us the first robust retarget to
80x86, I will be happy to discuss shared copyrights and royalties
from the book that’s upcoming.</p>
<p>But enough talk.  Let’s get on with  the  study  of  types.  As I
said  earlier,  we’ll  do  this  one  as  we  did  in   the  last
installment:  by  performing experiments  using  single-character
tokens.</p>
<h2 id="the-symbol-table"><a class="header" href="#the-symbol-table">The Symbol Table</a></h2>
<p>It should be apparent that, if we’re going to deal with variables
of different types, we’re going  to need someplace to record what
those  types are.  The obvious vehicle for  that  is  the  symbol
table, and we’ve already  used  it  that  way to distinguish, for
example,   between  local  and  global  variables,  and   between
variables and procedures.</p>
<p>The  symbol  table   structure  for  single-character  tokens  is
particularly simple, and we’ve used  it several times before.  To
deal with it, we’ll steal some procedures that we’ve used before.</p>
<p>First, we need to declare the symbol table itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Variable Declarations }

var Look: char;              { Lookahead Character }

    ST: Array['A'..'Z'] of char;   {  *** ADD THIS LINE ***}
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to make sure it’s initialized as part  of procedure
<code>Init</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Initialize }

procedure Init;
var i: char;
begin
   for i := 'A' to 'Z' do
      ST[i] := '?';
   GetChar;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>We don’t really need  the  next procedure, but it will be helpful
for debugging.  All it does is to dump the contents of the symbol
table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Dump the Symbol Table }

procedure DumpTable;
var i: char;
begin
   for i := 'A' to 'Z' do
      WriteLn(i, ' ', ST[i]);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>It really doesn’t matter much where you put this procedure  … I
plan to cluster all the symbol table routines together, so  I put
mine just after the error reporting procedures.</p>
<p>If  you’re  the  cautious type (as I am), you might want to begin
with a test program that does nothing but initializes, then dumps
the table.  Just to be sure that we’re all on the same wavelength
here, I’m reproducing the entire program below, complete with the
new  procedures.  Note that this  version  includes  support  for
white space:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}

   GetChar;
   SkipWhite;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Number }

function GetNum: char;
begin
   if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected('Integer');
   GetNum := Look;
   GetChar;
   SkipWhite;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Output a String with Tab }

procedure Emit(s: string);
begin
   Write(TAB, s);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Output a String with Tab and CRLF }

procedure EmitLn(s: string);
begin
   Emit(s);
   WriteLn;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Initialize }

procedure Init;
var i: char;
begin
   for i := 'A' to 'Z' do
      ST[i] := '?';
   GetChar;
   SkipWhite;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }

begin
   Init;
   DumpTable;
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>OK, run this program.  You  should  get a (very fast) printout of
all the letters of  the  alphabet  (potential  identifiers), each
followed by  a  question  mark.    Not  very exciting, but it’s a
start.</p>
<p>Of course, in general we  only  want  to  see  the  types  of the
variables that have been defined.  We can eliminate the others by
modifying <code>DumpTable</code> with an <code>IF</code> test.  Change the loop to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">for i := 'A' to 'Z' do
   if ST[i] &lt;&gt; '?' then
       WriteLn(i, ' ', ST[i]);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, run the program again.  What did you get?</p>
<p>Well, that’s even more  boring  than before!  There was no output
at all, since at this point <em>none</em> of the names have been declared.
We  can  spice  things up a  bit  by  inserting  some  statements
declaring some entries in the main program.  Try these:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">ST['A'] := 'a';
ST['P'] := 'b';
ST['X'] := 'c';
</code></pre>
<p>This time, when  you  run  the  program, you should get an output
showing that the symbol table is working right.</p>
<h2 id="adding-entries"><a class="header" href="#adding-entries">Adding Entries</a></h2>
<p>Of course, writing to the table directly is pretty poor practice,
and not one that will  help  us  much  later.   What we need is a
procedure to add entries to the table.  At the same time, we know
that  we’re going to need to test the table, to make sure that we
aren’t redeclaring a variable that’s already in use  (easy  to do
with only 26 choices!).  To handle all this, enter  the following
new procedures:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Report Type of a Variable }


function TypeOf(N: char): char;
begin
   TypeOf := ST[N];
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Report if a Variable is in the Table }


function InTable(N: char): boolean;
begin
   InTable := TypeOf(N) &lt;&gt; '?';
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Check for a Duplicate Variable Name }

procedure CheckDup(N: char);
begin
   if InTable(N) then Abort('Duplicate Name ' + N);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Add Entry to Table }

procedure AddEntry(N, T: char);
begin
   CheckDup(N);
   ST[N] := T;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now change the three lines in the main program to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">AddEntry('A', 'a');
AddEntry('P', 'b');
AddEntry('X', 'c');
</code></pre>
<p>and run the program again.  Did it work?  Then we have the symbol
table routines needed to support our work on types.  In  the next
section, we’ll actually begin to use them.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-storage"><a class="header" href="#allocating-storage">Allocating Storage</a></h2>
<p>In  other programs like this one,  including  the  TINY  compiler
itself, we have  already  addressed the issue of declaring global
variables, and the  code  generated  for  them.    Let’s  build a
vestigial version of a “compiler” here, whose only function is to
allow  us   declare  variables.    Remember,  the  syntax  for  a
declaration is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bnf">&lt;data decl&gt; ::= VAR &lt;identifier&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we can lift a lot of the code from previous programs.  The
following are stripped-down versions of those  procedures.   They
are greatly simplified  since  I  have  eliminated  niceties like
variable lists and  initializers.   In procedure <code>Alloc</code>, note that
the  new call to <code>AddEntry</code> will also  take  care  of  checking for
duplicate declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Allocate Storage for a Variable }

procedure Alloc(N: char);
begin
   AddEntry(N, 'v');
   WriteLn(N, ':', TAB, 'DC 0');
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Data Declaration }

procedure Decl;
var Name: char;
begin
   Match('v');
   Alloc(GetName);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate Global Declarations }

procedure TopDecls;
begin
   while Look &lt;&gt; '.' do begin
      case Look of
        'v': Decl;
      else Abort('Unrecognized Keyword ' + Look);
      end;
      Fin;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in the  main  program,  add  a  call to <code>TopDecls</code> and run the
program.  Try allocating a  few variables, and note the resulting
code generated.  This is old stuff for you, so the results should
look familiar.  Note from the code for <code>TopDecls</code> that  the program
is ended by a terminating period.</p>
<p>While you’re at it,  try  declaring  two  variables with the same
name, and verify that the parser catches the error.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-types"><a class="header" href="#declaring-types">Declaring Types</a></h2>
<p>Allocating storage of different sizes  is  as  easy  as modifying
procedure <code>TopDecls</code> to recognize more than one keyword.  There are
a  number  of  decisions to be made here, in terms  of  what  the
syntax should be, etc., but for now I’m  going  to  duck  all the
issues and simply declare by  executive fiat that our syntax will
be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bnf">&lt;data decl&gt; ::= &lt;typename&gt;  &lt;identifier&gt;

&lt;typename&gt; ::= BYTE | WORD | LONG
</code></pre>
<p>(By  an amazing coincidence, the first  letters  of  these  names
happen  to  be  the  same  as  the  68000  assembly  code  length
specifications, so this choice saves us a little work.)</p>
<p>We can create the code to take care of  these  declarations  with
only slight modifications.  In the routines below, note that I’ve
separated  the  code  generation parts of <code>Alloc</code>  from  the  logic
parts.  This  is  in  keeping  with our desire to encapsulate the
machine-dependent part of the compiler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate Code for Allocation of a Variable }

procedure AllocVar(N, T: char);
begin
   WriteLn(N, ':', TAB, 'DC.', T, ' 0');
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Allocate Storage for a Variable }

procedure Alloc(N, T: char);
begin
   AddEntry(N, T);
   AllocVar(N, T);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Data Declaration }

procedure Decl;
var Typ: char;
begin
   Typ := GetName;
   Alloc(GetName, Typ);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate Global Declarations }

procedure TopDecls;
begin
   while Look &lt;&gt; '.' do begin
      case Look of
        'b', 'w', 'l': Decl;
      else Abort('Unrecognized Keyword ' + Look);
      end;
      Fin;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Make the changes shown to these procedures, and give the  thing a
try.    Use  the  single  characters  <code>b</code>,  <code>w</code>,  and <code>l</code> for the
keywords (they must be lower case,  for  now).  You will see that
in each case, we are allocating the proper storage  size.    Note
from the dumped symbol table that the sizes are also recorded for
later use.  What later use?  Well, that’s the subject of the rest
of this installment.</p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Now that we can declare variables of different  sizes,  it stands
to reason that we ought to be able  to  do  something  with them.
For our first trick, let’s just try loading them into our working
register, <code>D0</code>.  It makes sense to use the same  idea  we used for
Alloc; that is, make a load procedure that can load more than one
size.    We  also  want  to continue to encapsulate the
machine-dependent stuff.  The load procedure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to Primary Register }

procedure LoadVar(Name, Typ: char);
begin
   Move(Typ, Name + '(PC)', 'D0');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>On  the  68000,  at least, it happens that many instructions turn
out to be <code>MOVE</code>s.  It turns out to be useful to create a separate
code generator just for these instructions, and then  call  it as
needed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate a Move Instruction }

procedure Move(Size: char; Source, Dest: String);
begin
   EmitLn('MOVE.' + Size + ' ' + Source + ',' + Dest);
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that these  two  routines are strictly code generators; they
have no error-checking or other  logic.  To complete the picture,
we need one more layer of software that provides these functions.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to make sure that the  type  we are dealing
with is a  loadable  type.    This  sounds like a job for another
recognizer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize a Legal Variable Type }

function IsVarType(c: char): boolean;
begin
   IsVarType := c in ['B', 'W', 'L'];
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, it would be nice to have a routine that will fetch the type
of a variable from the symbol table, while checking  it  to  make
sure it’s valid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Variable Type from the Symbol Table }

function VarType(Name: char): char;
var Typ: char;
begin
   Typ := TypeOf(Name);
   if not IsVarType(Typ) then Abort('Identifier ' + Name +
                                        ' is not a variable');
   VarType := Typ;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Armed with these  tools,  a  procedure  to cause a variable to be
loaded becomes trivial:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to the Primary Register }

procedure Load(Name: char);
begin
     LoadVar(Name, VarType(Name));
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong> to the  concerned:  I  know,  I  know, all this is all very
inefficient.  In a production  program,  we  probably  would take
steps to avoid such deep nesting of procedure calls.  Don’t worry
about it.  This is an <em>exercise</em>, remember?  It’s more important to
get it  right  and  understand  it, than it is to make it get the
wrong  answer,  quickly.   If you get your compiler completed and
find that you’re unhappy  with  the speed, feel free to come back
and hack the code to speed it up!)</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test the program at this point.  Since
we don’t have a  procedure  for  dealing  with assignments yet, I
just added the lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">Load('A');
Load('B');
Load('C');
Load('X');
</code></pre>
<p>to  the main program.  Thus, after  the  declaration  section  is
complete, they will be executed to generate code  for  the loads.
You can play around with  this, and try different combinations of
declarations to see how the errors are handled.</p>
<p>I’m sure you won’t be surprised to learn  that  storing variables
is a lot like  loading  them.  The necessary procedures are shown
next:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Store Primary to Variable }

procedure StoreVar(Name, Typ: char);
begin
   EmitLn('LEA ' + Name + '(PC),A0');
   Move(Typ, 'D0', '(A0)');
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Store a Variable from the Primary Register }

procedure Store(Name: char);
begin
   StoreVar(Name, VarType(Name));
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>You can test this one the same way as the loads.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s a <em>rather</em>  small  step to use these to handle
assignment  statements.  What we’ll do is  to  create  a  special
version   of  procedure  <code>Block</code>  that  supports  only   assignment
statements, and also a  special  version  of <code>Expression</code> that only
supports single variables as legal expressions.  Here they are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Expression }

procedure Expression;
var Name: char;
begin
   Load(GetName);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Assignment Statement }

procedure Assignment;
var Name: char;
begin
   Name := GetName;
   Match('=');
   Expression;
   Store(Name);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Block of Statements }

procedure Block;
begin
   while Look &lt;&gt; '.' do begin
      Assignment;
      Fin;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(It’s worth noting that, if  anything,  the  new  procedures that
permit us to manipulate types  are, if anything, even simpler and
cleaner than what we’ve seen before.  This is  mostly  thanks  to
our efforts to encapsulate the code generator procedures.)</p>
<p>There is one small, nagging problem.  Before, we used  the Pascal
terminating period to get us out of procedure <code>TopDecls</code>.   This is
now the wrong  character  …  it’s  used to terminate <code>Block</code>.  In
previous programs, we’ve used the <code>BEGIN</code> symbol  (abbreviated <code>b</code>)
to get us out.  But that is now used as a type symbol.</p>
<p>The solution, while somewhat of a kludge, is easy enough.   We’ll
use  an  upper-case <code>B</code> to stand for the <code>BEGIN</code>.   So  change  the
character in the <code>WHILE</code> loop within <code>TopDecls</code>, from <code>.</code> to <code>B</code>, and
everything will be fine.</p>
<p>Now, we can  complete  the  task  by changing the main program to
read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }

begin
   Init;
   TopDecls;
   Match('B');
   Fin;
   Block;
   DumpTable;
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(Note  that I’ve had to sprinkle a few calls to <code>Fin</code> around to get
us out of Newline troubles.)</p>
<p>OK, run this program.  Try the input:</p>
<pre><code>ba        { byte a }   *** DON'T TYPE THE COMMENTS!!! ***
wb        { word b }
lc        { long c }
B         { begin  }
a=a
a=b
a=c
b=a
b=b
b=c
c=a
c=b
c=c
.
</code></pre>
<p>For  each  declaration,  you  should  get  code   generated  that
allocates storage.  For each assignment, you should get code that
loads a variable of the correct size, and stores one, also of the
correct size.</p>
<p>There’s only one small  little  problem:    The generated code is
<em>wrong</em>!</p>
<p>Look at the code for a=c above.  The code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">MOVE.L    C(PC),D0
LEA       A(PC),A0
MOVE.B    D0,(A0)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is correct.  It will cause the lower eight bits of C to
be stored into A, which is a reasonable behavior.  It’s about all
we can expect to happen.</p>
<p>But now, look at the opposite case.  For <code>c=a</code>, the  code generated
is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">MOVE.B A(PC),D0
LEA  C(PC),A0
MOVE.L D0,(A0)
</code></pre>
<p>This is  <em>not</em>  correct.    It will cause the byte variable <code>A</code> to be
stored into the lower eight bits  of  <code>D0</code>.  According to the rules
for the 68000 processor,  the  upper 24 bits are unchanged.  This
means  that when we store the entire 32  bits  into  C,  whatever
garbage  that  was  in those high bits will also get stored.  Not
good.</p>
<p>So what  we  have  run  into here, early on, is the issue of <em>type
conversion</em>, or <em>coercion</em>.</p>
<p>Before we do anything with  variables of different types, even if
it’s just to  copy  them, we have to face up to the issue.  It is
not the most easy part of a compiler.  Most of  the  bugs  I have
seen in production compilers  have  had to do with errors in type
conversion for  some obscure combination of arguments.  As usual,
there is a tradeoff between compiler complexity and the potential
quality of the  generated  code,  and  as usual, we will take the
path that keeps the  compiler  simple.  I think you’ll find that,
with this approach, we can keep the potential complexity in check
rather nicely.</p>
<h2 id="the-cowards-way-out"><a class="header" href="#the-cowards-way-out">The Coward’s Way Out</a></h2>
<p>Before we get into the details (and potential complexity) of type
conversion,  I’d  like  you to see that there is one super-simple
way to solve the problem: simply promote every variable to a long
integer when we load it!</p>
<p>This takes the addition of only one line to <code>LoadVar</code>,  although if
we  are  not  going to <em>completely</em> ignore efficiency, it should be
guarded by an <code>IF</code> test.  Here is the modified version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to Primary Register }

procedure LoadVar(Name, Typ: char);
begin
   if Typ &lt;&gt; 'L' then
      EmitLn('CLR.L D0');
   Move(Typ, Name + '(PC)', 'D0');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that <code>StoreVar</code> needs no similar change.)</p>
<p>If you run some tests with  this  new version, you will find that
everything  works correctly now, albeit sometimes  inefficiently.
For example, consider the case  <code>a=b</code>  (for  the  same declarations
shown above).  Now the generated code turns out to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">CLR.L D0
MOVE.W B(PC),D0
LEA  A(PC),A0
MOVE.B D0,(A0)
</code></pre>
<p>In  this  case,  the <code>CLR</code> turns out not to be necessary, since the
result is going into a byte-sized variable.  With a little bit of
work, we can do better.  Still, this is not  bad,  and it typical
of the kinds of inefficiencies  that we’ve seen before in simple-minded
compilers.</p>
<p>I should point out that, by setting the high bits to zero, we are
in effect treating the numbers as <em>unsigned</em> integers.  If  we want
to treat them as signed ones instead (the more  likely  case)  we
should do a  sign  extension  after  the load, instead of a clear
before it. Just  to  tie  this  part  of the discussion up with a
nice, red ribbon, let’s change <code>LoadVar</code> as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to Primary Register }

procedure LoadVar(Name, Typ: char);
begin
   if Typ = 'B' then
      EmitLn('CLR.L D0');
   Move(Typ, Name + '(PC)', 'D0');
   if Typ = 'W' then
      EmitLn('EXT.L D0');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>With this version, a byte is treated as unsigned  (as  in  Pascal
and C), while a word is treated as signed.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-reasonable-solution"><a class="header" href="#a-more-reasonable-solution">A More Reasonable Solution</a></h2>
<p>As we’ve seen, promoting  every  variable  to  long while it’s in
memory solves the problem, but it can hardly be called efficient,
and  probably wouldn’t be acceptable even for  those  of  us  who
claim be unconcerned about  efficiency.    It  will mean that all
arithmetic operations will be done to 32-bit accuracy, which will
<em>double</em> the run time  for  most operations, and make it even worse
for multiplication  and division.  For those operations, we would
need to call subroutines to do  them,  even if the data were byte
or  word types.  The whole thing is sort of a cop-out, too, since
it ducks all the real issues.</p>
<p>OK, so that solution’s no good.  Is there still a relatively easy
way to get data conversion?  Can we still Keep It Simple?</p>
<p>Yes, indeed.   All we have to do is to make the conversion at the
other end … that is, we convert on the way <em>out</em>, when the data
is stored, rather than on the way in.</p>
<p>But, remember, the storage part  of the assignment is pretty much
independent of the data load, which is taken care of by procedure
<code>Expression</code>.    In  general  the  expression  may  be  arbitrarily
complex, so how can procedure <code>Assignment</code> know what  type  of data
is left in register <code>D0</code>?</p>
<p>Again,  the  answer  is  simple:    We’ll  just  <em>ask</em>  procedure
<code>Expression</code>!  The answer can be returned as a function value.</p>
<p>All of this requires several procedures to be  modified,  but the
mods, like the method, are quite simple.  First of all,  since we
aren’t requiring <code>LoadVar</code> to do  all the work of conversion, let’s
go back to the simple version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to Primary Register }

procedure LoadVar(Name, Typ: char);
begin
   Move(Typ, Name + '(PC)', 'D0');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let’s add a  new  procedure that will convert from one type
to another:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Convert a Data Item from One Type to Another }


procedure Convert(Source, Dest: char);
begin
   if Source &lt;&gt; Dest then begin
      if Source  = 'B' then
         EmitLn('AND.W #$FF,D0');
      if Dest = 'L' then
         EmitLn('EXT.L D0');
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to do  the  logic  required  to  load  and  store a
variable of any type.  Here are the routines for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Variable to the Primary Register }

function Load(Name: char): char;
var Typ : char;
begin
   Typ := VarType(Name);
   LoadVar(Name, Typ);
   Load := Typ;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Store a Variable from the Primary Register }

procedure Store(Name, T1: char);
var T2: char;
begin
   T2 := VarType(Name);
   Convert(T1, T2);
   StoreVar(Name, T2);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>Load</code> is a function, which not only emits the code for a
load, but also returns the variable type.  In this way, we always
know what type of data we  are  dealing  with.  When we execute a
<code>Store</code>,  we pass it the current type of the variable in <code>D0</code>.  Since
<code>Store</code> also knows the  type  of  the  destination variable, it can
convert as necessary.</p>
<p>Armed  with all these new routines,  the  implementation  of  our
rudimentary   assignment   statement  is   essentially   trivial.
Procedure <code>Expression</code> now becomes a  function,  which  returns its
type to procedure <code>Assignment</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Expression }

function Expression: char;
begin
   Expression := Load(GetName);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Assignment Statement }

procedure Assignment;
var Name: char;
begin
   Name := GetName;
   Match('=');
   Store(Name, Expression);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, note how  incredibly  simple these two routines are. We’ve
encapsulated  all the type logic into <code>Load</code>  and  <code>Store</code>,  and  the
trick of  passing  the  type  around  makes  the rest of the work
extremely easy.    Of  course,  all  of  this is for our special,
trivial case of <code>Expression</code>.  Naturally, for the  general  case it
will have to get more complex.  But  you’re  looking  now  at the
<em>final</em> version of procedure <code>Assignment</code>!</p>
<p>All this seems like a very  simple  and clean solution, and it is
indeed.   Compile this program and run the  same  test  cases  as
before.    You will see that all  types  of  data  are  converted
properly, and there are few if any wasted instructions.  Only the
byte-to-long conversion uses two instructions where one would do,
and we could easily modify <code>Convert</code> to handle this case, too.</p>
<p>Although we haven’t considered unsigned variables in this case, I
think you can see  that  we could easily fix up procedure <code>Convert</code>
to deal with these types as well.  This is  “left  as an exercise
for the student.”</p>
<h2 id="literal-arguments"><a class="header" href="#literal-arguments">Literal Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Sharp-eyed readers might have noticed, though, that we don’t even
have a proper form of a simple factor yet, because we don’t allow
for loading literal constants,  only  variables.   Let’s fix that
now.</p>
<p>To begin with, we’ll need a <code>GetNum</code> function.  We’ve  seen several
versions of this, some returning  only a single character, some a
string, and some an integer.   The  one needed here will return a
<code>LongInt</code>, so that it can handle anything we  throw  at  it.   Note
that no type information is returned here: <code>GetNum</code> doesn’t concern
itself with how the number will be used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Number }

function GetNum: LongInt;
var Val: LongInt;
begin
   if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected('Integer');
   Val := 0;
   while IsDigit(Look) do begin
      Val := 10 * Val + Ord(Look) - Ord('0');
      GetChar;
   end;
   GetNum := Val;
   SkipWhite;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when dealing with  literal  data,  we  have one little small
problem.   With variables, we know what  type  things  should  be
because they’ve been declared to be  that  type.  We have no such
type information for  literals.   When the programmer says, <code>-1</code>,
does that mean a byte, word, or longword  version?    We  have no
clue.  The obvious thing to do would be to  use  the largest type
possible, i.e. a longword.    But that’s a bad idea, because when
we get to more complex expressions, we’ll find that it will cause
every expression involving literals  to  be  promoted to long, as
well.</p>
<p>A better approach is to select a type based upon the value of the
literal, as shown next:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Constant to the Primary Register }

function LoadNum(N: LongInt): char;
var Typ : char;
begin
   if abs(N) &lt;= 127 then
      Typ := 'B'
   else if abs(N) &lt;= 32767 then
      Typ := 'W'
   else Typ := 'L';
   LoadConst(N, Typ);
   LoadNum := Typ;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(I know, I know, the number base isn’t really symmetric.  You can
store <code>-128</code> in a single byte,  and  <code>-32768</code>  in a word.  But that’s
easily fixed, and not  worth  the time or the added complexity to
fool with it here.  It’s the thought that counts.)</p>
<p>Note  that  <code>LoadNum</code>  calls  a  new version of the code  generator
routine  <code>LoadConst</code>, which has an added  argument  to  define  the
type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Load a Constant to the Primary Register }

procedure LoadConst(N: LongInt; Typ: char);
var temp:string;
begin
   Str(N, temp);
   Move(Typ, '#' + temp, 'D0');
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now  we can modify procedure <code>Expression</code>  to  accommodate  the  two
possible kinds of factors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Expression }

function Expression: char;
begin
   if IsAlpha(Look) then
      Expression := Load(GetName)
   else
      Expression := LoadNum(GetNum);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(Wow, that sure didn’t hurt too bad!  Just a  few  extra lines do
the job.)</p>
<p>OK,  compile  this code into your program  and  give  it  a  try.
You’ll see that it now works for either variables or constants as
valid expressions.</p>
<h2 id="additive-expressions"><a class="header" href="#additive-expressions">Additive Expressions</a></h2>
<p>If you’ve been following this series from the beginning, I’m sure
you  know  what’s coming next:  We’ll  expand  the  form  for  an
expression   to   handle   first   additive   expressions,   then
multiplicative, then general expressions with parentheses.</p>
<p>The nice part is that we already have a pattern for  dealing with
these more complex expressions.  All we have  to  do  is  to make
sure that  all the procedures called by <code>Expression</code> (<code>Term</code>, <code>Factor</code>,
etc.)  always  return a type identifier.   If  we  do  that,  the
program structure gets changed hardly at all.</p>
<p>The  first  step  is  easy:  We can rename our existing  function
<code>Expression</code>  to  <code>Term</code>,  as  we’ve  done so many times before,  and
create the new version of <code>Expression</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate an Expression }

function Expression: char;
var Typ: char;
begin
   if IsAddop(Look) then
      Typ := Unop
   else
      Typ := Term;
   while IsAddop(Look) do begin
      Push(Typ);
      case Look of
       '+': Typ := Add(Typ);
       '-': Typ := Subtract(Typ);
      end;
   end;
   Expression := Typ;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Note  in  this  routine how each  procedure  call  has  become  a
function call, and how  the  local  variable  Typ gets updated at
each pass.</p>
<p>Note also the new call to a function  <code>Unop</code>,  which  lets  us deal
with a leading unary minus.  This change is not necessary  … we
could  still  use  a form more like what we’ve done before.  I’ve
chosen  to  introduce  UnOp as a separate routine because it will
make it easier, later, to produce somewhat better code than we’ve
been  doing.    In other words, I’m looking ahead to optimization
issues.</p>
<p>For  this  version,  though, we’ll retain the same dumb old code,
which makes the new routine trivial:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Process a Term with Leading Unary Operator }

function Unop: char;
begin
   Clear;
   Unop := 'W';
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Procedure  <code>Push</code>  is  a code-generator routine, and now has a type
argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Push Primary onto Stack }

procedure Push(Size: char);
begin
   Move(Size, 'D0', '-(SP)');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at functions <code>Add</code>  and  <code>Subtract</code>.    In the
older versions of these routines, we let them call code generator
routines <code>PopAdd</code> and <code>PopSub</code>.    We’ll  continue  to do that, which
makes the functions themselves extremely simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate an Add }

function Add(T1: char): char;
begin
   Match('+');
   Add := PopAdd(T1, Term);
end;


{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Subtract }

function Subtract(T1: char): char;
begin
   Match('-');
   Subtract := PopSub(T1, Term);
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>The simplicity is  deceptive,  though, because what we’ve done is
to defer all the logic to <code>PopAdd</code> and <code>PopSub</code>, which are  no longer
just code generation routines.    They must also now take care of
the type conversions required.</p>
<p>And just what conversion is that?  Simple: Both arguments must be
of the same size, and the result  is  also  of  that  size.   The
smaller of the two arguments must be “promoted” to  the  size  of
the larger one.</p>
<p>But  this  presents a bit of a problem.  If the  argument  to  be
promoted is the second argument  (i.e.  in  the  primary register
D0), we  are  in  great  shape.  If it’s not, however, we’re in a
fix: we can’t change the size of the  information  that’s already
been pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>The solution is simple but a little painful: We must abandon that
lovely  “pop  the  data and do something  with  it”  instructions
thoughtfully provided by Motorola.</p>
<p>The alternative is to assign  a  secondary  register,  which I’ve
chosen to be <code>R7</code>.  (Why not <code>R1</code>?  Because I  have  later  plans for
the other registers.)</p>
<p>The  first  step in this new structure  is  to  introduce  a  <code>Pop</code>
procedure analogous to the <code>Push</code>.   This procedure will always <code>Pop</code>
the top element of the stack into <code>D7</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Pop Stack into Secondary Register }

procedure Pop(Size: char);
begin
   Move(Size, '(SP)+', 'D7');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>The general idea is that all the “Pop-Op” routines can  call this
one.    When  this is done, we will then have  both  operands  in
registers, so we can promote whichever  one  we need to.  To deal
with this, procedure <code>Convert</code> needs another argument, the register
name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Convert a Data Item from One Type to Another }

procedure Convert(Source, Dest: char; Reg: String);
begin
   if Source &lt;&gt; Dest then begin
      if Source  = 'B' then
         EmitLn('AND.W #$FF,' + Reg);
      if Dest = 'L' then
         EmitLn('EXT.L ' + Reg);
   end;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>The next function does a conversion, but only if the current type
<code>T1</code>  is  smaller  in size than the desired  type  <code>T2</code>.    It  is  a
function, returning the final type to let us know what it decided
to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Promote the Size of a Register Value }

function Promote(T1, T2: char; Reg: string): char;
var Typ: char;
begin
   Typ := T1;
   if T1 &lt;&gt; T2 then
      if (T1 = 'B') or ((T1 = 'W') and (T2 = 'L')) then begin
         Convert(T1, T2, Reg);
         Typ := T2;
      end;
   Promote := Typ;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the following function forces the two registers to be of
the same type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Force both Arguments to Same Type }

function SameType(T1, T2: char): char;
begin
   T1 := Promote(T1, T2, 'D7');
   SameType := Promote(T2, T1, 'D0');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>These new routines give us the ammunition we need  to  flesh  out
<code>PopAdd</code> and <code>PopSub</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate Code to Add Primary to the Stack }

function PopAdd(T1, T2: char): char;
begin
   Pop(T1);
   T2 := SameType(T1, T2);
   GenAdd(T2);
   PopAdd := T2;
end;


{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate Code to Subtract Primary from the Stack }

function PopSub(T1, T2: char): char;
begin
   Pop(T1);
   T2 := SameType(T1, T2);
   GenSub(T2);
   PopSub := T2;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>After  all   the   buildup,   the   final   results   are  almost
anticlimactic.  Once  again,  you can see that the logic is quite
simple.  All the two routines do is to pop the  top-of-stack into
<code>D7</code>, force the two operands to be the same size, and then generate
the code.</p>
<p>Note  the  new  code generator routines <code>GenAdd</code> and <code>GenSub</code>.  These
are vestigial forms of the <em>original</em> <code>PopAdd</code> and <code>PopSub</code>.   That is,
they  are pure code generators, producing a  register-to-register
add or subtract:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Add Top of Stack to Primary }

procedure GenAdd(Size: char);
begin
   EmitLn('ADD.' + Size + ' D7,D0');
end;


{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Subtract Primary from Top of Stack }

procedure GenSub(Size: char);
begin
   EmitLn('SUB.' + Size + ' D7,D0');
   EmitLn('NEG.' + Size + ' D0');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>OK,  I grant you:  I’ve thrown a lot of routines at you since  we
last tested the code.   But  you  have  to  admit  that  each new
routine is pretty simple and transparent.  If you (like me) don’t
like to test so many new  routines  at  once, that’s OK.  You can
stub out routines like <code>Convert</code>, <code>Promote</code>, and <code>SameType</code>, since they
don’t  read  any inputs.  You won’t  get  the  correct  code,  of
course, but things should work.  Then flesh  them  out  one  at a
time.</p>
<p>When testing the program,  don’t  forget  that  you first have to
declare some variables, and then  start the “body” of the program
with an upper-case  <code>B</code>  (for  <code>BEGIN</code>).   You should find that the
parser  will  handle  any  additive  expressions.  Once  all  the
conversion routines are in, you should see that the  correct code
is  generated,  with  type  conversions inserted where necessary.
Try mixing up variables  of  different  sizes, and also literals.
Make sure that everything’s working properly.  As  usual,  it’s a
good  idea  to  try  some  erroneous expressions and see how  the
compiler handles them.</p>
<h2 id="why-so-many-procedures"><a class="header" href="#why-so-many-procedures">Why So Many Procedures?</a></h2>
<p>At this point, you may think  I’ve  pretty much gone off the deep
end in terms of deeply nested procedures.  There is  admittedly a
lot of overhead here.  But there’s a method in my madness.  As in
the case of <code>UnOp</code>, I’m looking ahead to the time when  we’re going
to want better code  generation.   The way the code is organized,
we can achieve  this  without major modifications to the program.
For example, in cases where the value pushed onto the  stack does
<em>not</em> have to be converted, it’s still better to use the “pop and
add”  instruction.    If we choose to test for such cases, we can
embed the extra tests into  <code>PopAdd</code>  and  <code>PopSub</code>  without changing
anything else much.</p>
<h2 id="multiplicative-expressions"><a class="header" href="#multiplicative-expressions">Multiplicative Expressions</a></h2>
<p>The procedure for dealing with multiplicative  operators  is much
the  same.    In  fact,  at  the  first  level,  they are  almost
identical, so I’ll just show them here without much fanfare.  The
first  one  is  our  general  form  for  <code>Factor</code>,  which  includes
parenthetical subexpressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Factor }

function Expression: char; Forward;

function Factor: char;
begin
   if Look = '(' then begin
      Match('(');
      Factor := Expression;
      Match(')');
      end
   else if IsAlpha(Look) then
      Factor := Load(GetName)
   else
      Factor := LoadNum(GetNum);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Multiply }

Function Multiply(T1: char): char;
begin
   Match('*');
   Multiply := PopMul(T1, Factor);
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize and Translate a Divide }

function Divide(T1: char): char;
begin
   Match('/');
   DIvide := PopDiv(T1, Factor);
end;


{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Parse and Translate a Math Term }

function Term: char;
var Typ: char;
begin
   Typ := Factor;
   while IsMulop(Look) do begin
      Push(Typ);
      case Look of
       '*': Typ := Multiply(Typ);
       '/': Typ := Divide(Typ);
      end;
   end;
   Term := Typ;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>These routines parallel the additive  ones  almost  exactly.   As
before, the complexity is encapsulated within <code>PopMul</code>  and <code>PopDiv</code>.
If  you’d  like  to test the program before we get into that, you
can build dummy versions of them, similar to  <code>PopAdd</code>  and <code>PopSub</code>.
Again, the code won’t be correct at this point,  but  the  parser
should handle expressions of arbitrary complexity.</p>
<h2 id="multiplication"><a class="header" href="#multiplication">Multiplication</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve  convinced yourself that the parser itself is working
properly, we need to figure out what it will take to generate the
right code.  This is where  things  begin to get a little sticky,
because the rules are more complex.</p>
<p>Let’s take the case of multiplication first.   This  operation is
similar to the “addops” in that both operands should  be  of  the
same size.  It differs in two important respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type of the product is typically not the same as that of
the  two  operands.   For the product of two words, we get a
longword result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 68000 does  not support a 32 x 32 multiply, so a call to
a software routine is needed.  This routine will become part
of the run-time library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also does  not  support  an  8  x 8 multiply, so all byte
operands must be promoted to words.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The actions that we have to take are best shown in  the following
table:</p>
<pre><code>-----------------------------------------------------------------
  T1 --&gt;  |                 |                 |                 |

     B    | Convert D0 to W | Convert D0 to W | Convert D0 to L |
          | Convert D7 to W |                 |                 |

          |                 |                 |                 |

          |                 |                 |                 |

     L    | Convert D7 to L | Convert D7 to L |                 |
          | JSR MUL32       | JSR MUL32       | JSR MUL32       |
          | Result = L      | Result = L      | Result = L      |
          |                 |                 |                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>This table shows the actions to be taken for each  combination of
operand types.  There are three things to note: First,  we assume
a library routine  <code>MUL32</code>  which  performs  a  32  x  32 multiply,
leaving a <strong>32-bit</strong> (not 64-bit) product.    If  there  is any
overflow in the process,  we  choose to ignore it and return only
the lower 32 bits.</p>
<p>Second, note that the  table  is  symmetric  … the two operands
enter in the same way.  Finally, note that the product  is <em>always</em>
a longword, except when  both  operands  are  bytes.  (It’s worth
noting, in passing, that  this  means  that many expressions will
end up being longwords, whether we  like  it or not.  Perhaps the
idea  of  just  promoting  them  all  up  front wasn’t  all  that
outrageous, after all!)</p>
<p>Now, clearly, we are going to have to generate different code for
the 16-bit and 32-bit multiplies.  This is best  done  by  having
separate code generator routines for the two cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Multiply Top of Stack by Primary (Word) }

procedure GenMult;
begin
   EmitLn('MULS D7,D0')
end;


{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Multiply Top of Stack by Primary (Long) }

procedure GenLongMult;
begin
   EmitLn('JSR MUL32');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>An examination of the code below for <code>PopMul</code>  should  convince you
that the conditions in the table are met:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate Code to Multiply Primary by Stack }

function PopMul(T1, T2: char): char;
var T: char;
begin
   Pop(T1);
   T := SameType(T1, T2);
   Convert(T, 'W', 'D7');
   Convert(T, 'W', 'D0');
   if T = 'L' then
      GenLongMult
   else
      GenMult;
   if T = 'B' then
      PopMul := 'W'
   else
      PopMul:= 'L';
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the routine starts off just like <code>PopAdd</code>.  The two
arguments are forced to the same type.  The two calls  to <code>Convert</code>
take  care  of  the case where both operands are bytes.  The data
themselves are promoted  to  words, but the routine remembers the
type so as to assign the correct type to the result.  Finally, we
call one of the two code generator routines, and then  assign the
result type.  Not too complicated, really.</p>
<p>At this point, I suggest that you go ahead and test  the program.
Try all combinations of operand sizes.</p>
<h2 id="division"><a class="header" href="#division">Division</a></h2>
<p>The case of division is not nearly so  symmetric.    I  also have
some bad news for you:</p>
<p>All  modern  16-bit   CPU’s   support   integer   divide.     The
manufacturer’s data  sheet  will  describe  this  operation  as a
32 x 16-bit divide, meaning that you can divide a 32-bit dividend
by a 16-bit divisor.  Here’s the bad news:</p>
<p>THEY’RE LYING TO YOU!!!</p>
<p>If you don’t believe  it,  try  dividing  any large 32-bit number
(meaning that it has non-zero bits  in  the upper 16 bits) by the
integer <code>1</code>.  You are guaranteed to get an overflow exception.</p>
<p>The  problem is that the instruction  really  requires  that  the
resulting quotient fit into a 16-bit result.   This  won’t happen
<em>unless</em> the divisor is  sufficiently  large.    When any number is
divided by unity, the quotient will of course be the same  as the
dividend, which had better fit into a 16-bit word.</p>
<p>Since  the  beginning  of  time  (well,  computers,  anyway), CPU
architects have  provided  this  little  gotcha  in  the division
circuitry.  It provides a certain amount of  symmetry  in things,
since it is sort of the inverse of the way a multiply works.  But
since  unity  is  a perfectly valid (and rather common) number to
use as a divisor, the division as implemented  in  hardware needs
some help from us programmers.</p>
<p>The implications are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type of the quotient must always be the same as  that of
the dividend.  It is independent of the divisor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In spite of  the  fact  that  the  CPU  supports  a longword
dividend,  the hardware-provided  instruction  can  only  be
trusted  for  byte  and  word  dividends.      For  longword
dividends, we need another library routine that can return a
long result.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  looks  like  a job for  another  table,  to  summarize  the
required actions:</p>

<p>(You may wonder why it’s necessary to do a 32-bit  division, when
the  dividend is, say, only a byte in the first place.  Since the
number  of bits in the result can only be as many as that in  the
dividend,  why  bother?   The reason is that, if the divisor is a
longword,  and  there  are any high bits set in it, the result of
the division must  be zero.  We might not get that if we only use
the lower word of the divisor.)</p>
<p>The following code provides the correct function for PopDiv:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Generate Code to Divide Stack by the Primary }

function PopDiv(T1, T2: char): char;
begin
   Pop(T1);
   Convert(T1, 'L', 'D7');
   if (T1 = 'L') or (T2 = 'L') then begin
      Convert(T2, 'L', 'D0');
      GenLongDiv;
      PopDiv := 'L';
      end
   else begin
      Convert(T2, 'W', 'D0');
      GenDiv;
      PopDiv := T1;
   end;
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>The two code generation procedures are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Divide Top of Stack by Primary  (Word) }

procedure GenDiv;
begin
   EmitLn('DIVS D0,D7');
   Move('W', 'D7', 'D0');
end;


{---------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Divide Top of Stack by Primary (Long) }

procedure GenLongDiv;
begin
   EmitLn('JSR DIV32');
end;
{---------------------------------------------------------------}

</code></pre>
<p>Note  that  we  assume that <code>DIV32</code> leaves the (longword) result in
<code>D0</code>.</p>
<p>OK, install the new  procedures  for division.  At this point you
should be able  to  generate  code  for  any  kind  of arithmetic
expression.  Give it a whirl!</p>
<h2 id="beginning-to-wind-down"><a class="header" href="#beginning-to-wind-down">Beginning to Wind Down</a></h2>
<p>At  last, in this installment, we’ve learned  how  to  deal  with
variables (and literals) of different types.  As you can  see, it
hasn’t been too tough.  In  fact,  in  some ways most of the code
looks even more simple than it does in earlier  programs.    Only
the  multiplication  and  division  operators  require  a  little
thinking and planning.</p>
<p>The main concept that  made  things  easy  was that of converting
procedures such as <code>Expression</code> into functions that return the type
of the result.  Once this  was  done,  we were able to retain the
same general structure of the compiler.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend that  we’ve  covered  every  single aspect of the
issue.  I conveniently  ignored  unsigned  arithmetic.  From what
we’ve  done, I think you can see that to include them adds no new
challenges, just extra possibilities to test for.</p>
<p>I’ve also ignored the  logical  operators And, Or, etc.  It turns
out  that  these are pretty easy to  handle.    All  the  logical
operators are  bitwise  operations,  so  they  are  symmetric and
therefore work  in  the  same  fashion  as  <code>PopAdd</code>.  There is one
difference,  however:    if  it  is necessary to extend the  word
length for a logical variable, the extension should be done as an
<em>unsigned</em>  number.      Floating   point   numbers,   again,   are
straightforward  to  handle  … just a few more procedures to be
added to the run-time library, or perhaps instructions for a math
chip.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, I have also skirted the  issue  of type
<em>checking</em>,  as  opposed  to  conversion.   In other  words,  we’ve
allowed for operations between variables of  all  combinations of
types.  In general this will not be true … certainly  you don’t
want to add an integer, for example, to a string.  Most languages
also don’t allow you to mix up character and integer variables.</p>
<p>Again, there are  really  no  new  issues to be addressed in this
case.  We are already checking the types of the two  operands …
much  of this checking gets done  in  procedures  like  SameType.
It’s  pretty  straightforward  to  include  a  call  to an  error
handler, if the types of the two operands are incompatible.</p>
<p>In the general  case,  we  can  think of every single operator as
being handled by  a  different procedure, depending upon the type
of the two operands.  This is straightforward, though tedious, to
implement simply by implementing  a  jump  table with the operand
types  as indices.  In Pascal,  the  equivalent  operation  would
involve nested Case statements.    Some  of the called procedures
could then be simple  error  routines,  while others could effect
whatever kind of conversion we need.  As more  types  are  added,
the number of procedures goes up by a square-law rule, but that’s
still not an unreasonably large number of procedures.</p>
<p>What  we’ve  done  here is to collapse such a jump table into far
fewer  procedures, simply by making use  of  symmetry  and  other
simplifying rules.</p>
<h2 id="to-coerce-or-not-to-coerce"><a class="header" href="#to-coerce-or-not-to-coerce">To Coerce or Not to Coerce</a></h2>
<p>In case you haven’t gotten this message yet, it sure appears that
TINY and KISS will  probably  <em>not</em>  be strongly typed languages,
since I’ve allowed for  automatic  mixing  and conversion of just
about any type.  Which brings up the next issue:</p>
<p>Is this really what we want to do?</p>
<p>The answer depends on what kind of language you want, and the way
you’d like it to behave.  What we have not addressed is the issue
of when to allow and when to deny the use of operations involving
different  data  types.   In other  words,  what  should  be  the
<em>semantics</em> of our compiler?   Do we want automatic type conversion
for all cases, for some cases, or not at all?</p>
<p>Let’s pause here to think about this a bit more.   To  do  so, it
will help to look at a bit of history.</p>
<p>FORTRAN  II supported only two simple  data  types:  <code>Integer</code>  and
<code>Real</code>.    It  allowed implicit type conversion  between  real  and
integer types during assignment, but not within expressions.  All
data items (including literal constants) on  the  right-hand side
of an assignment statement had to be of the same type.  That made
things pretty easy  …  much  simpler  than what we’ve had to do
here.</p>
<p>This  was  changed  in  FORTRAN   IV   to   support  “mixed-mode”
arithmetic.  If an expression had any real data items in it, they
were all converted to reals and the expression  itself  was real.
To round out  the  picture, functions were provided to explicitly
convert  from  one  type to the other, so that you could force an
expression to end up as either type.</p>
<p>This  led to two things:  code that was easier to write, and code
that was less efficient.  That’s because sloppy programmers would
write expressions with simple  constants  like  0  and 1 in them,
which  the  compiler  would  dutifully  compile  to   convert  at
execution  time.  Still, the system  worked  pretty  well,  which
would  tend  to  indicate that implicit type conversion is a Good
Thing.</p>
<p>C is also a weakly typed language, though it  supports  a  larger
number  of types.  C won’t complain if you try to add a character
to an integer,  for  example.    Partly,  this is helped by the C
convention of promoting every char  to integer when it is loaded,
or  passed  through  a  parameter  list.    This  simplifies  the
conversions quite a  bit.    In  fact, in subset C compilers that
don’t support long or float types,  we  end up back where we were
in our earlier,  simple-minded  first try: every variable has the
same representation, once loaded into  a  register.    Makes life
pretty easy!</p>
<p>The  ultimate  language  in  the  direction  of   automatic  type
conversion is PL/I.   This  language  supports  a large number of
data types, and you can mix them all  freely.    If  the implicit
conversions of FORTRAN seemed good,  then  those  of  PL/I should
have been Heaven, but it turned  out  to  be more like Hell!  The
problem was that with so many data types, there had to be a large
number  of  different conversions, <em>and</em>  a  correspondingly  large
number of rules about how  mixed  operands  should  be converted.
These rules became so  complex  that  no  one could remember what
they  were!  A lot of the errors in PL/I programs had to do  with
unexpected and unwanted type  conversions.    Too  much of a Good
Thing can be bad for you!</p>
<p>Pascal,  on  the  other hand, is a  language  which  is “strongly
typed,” which means that in general you can’t mix types,  even if
they differ only in <em>name</em>, and yet have the same base type!
Niklaus Wirth made Pascal strongly typed to help keep programmers
out of trouble, and  the  restrictions  have  indeed saved many a
programmer from themself, because the compiler kept them from doing
something dumb.  Better  to  find  the  bug in compilation rather
than  the  debug  phase.    The same restrictions can also  cause
frustration when you really  <em>want</em>  to mix types, and they tend to
drive an ex-C-programmer up the wall.</p>
<p>Even so, Pascal does permit some implicit conversions.    You can
assign  an integer to a real value.  You can also mix integer and
real types in  expressions  of  type  <code>Real</code>.  The integers will be
automatically coerced to real, just as in FORTRAN  (and  with the
same hidden cost in run-time overhead).</p>
<p>You can’t, however, convert the  other way, from real to integer,
without applying an explicit  conversion  function,  <code>Trunc</code>.   The
theory here is that,  since  the numerical value of a real number
is  necessarily  going  to  be  changed  by  the conversion  (the
fractional  part will be lost), you really  shouldn’t  do  it  in
“secret.”</p>
<p>In the spirit of strong typing, Pascal will not allow you  to mix
<code>Char</code>  and  <code>Integer</code>   variables,  without  applying  the  explicit
coercion functions Chr and Ord.</p>
<p>Turbo Pascal also includes the  types  <code>Byte</code>,  <code>Word</code>,  and <code>LongInt</code>.
The first two are basically the same as unsigned  integers.    In
Turbo,  these can be freely intermixed  with  variables  of  type
<code>Integer</code>,  and  Turbo will automatically  handle  the  conversion.
There are run-time  checks,  though, to keep you from overflowing
or otherwise getting the wrong  answer. Note that you still can’t
mix <code>Byte</code> and <code>Char</code> types, even though they  are  stored internally
in the same representation.</p>
<p>The ultimate in a  strongly-typed  language  is Ada, which allows
<em>no</em>  implicit  type  conversions at all, and also will not allow
mixed-mode  arithmetic.    Jean   Ichbiah’s   position   is  that
conversions cost  execution time, and you shouldn’t be allowed to
build in such cost in a hidden manner.  By forcing the programmer
to  explicitly  request  a  type  conversion,  you  make it  more
apparent that there could be a cost involved.</p>
<p>I have been using another strongly-typed  language,  a delightful
little  language  called  Whimsical,  by  John  Spray.   Although
Whimsical is  intended as a systems programming language, it also
requires explicit conversion <em>every</em> time.    There  are  <em>never</em> any
automatic conversions, even the ones supported by Pascal.</p>
<p>This approach does  have  certain advantages:  The compiler never
has to guess what to do: the programmer always tells it precisely
what  they  want.  As a result, there tends to be  a  more  nearly
one-to-one correspondence between  source code and compiled code,
and John’s compiler produces <em>very</em> tight code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I sometimes find the  explicit  conversions to
be a pain.  If I want, for example, to add one to a character, or
AND it with a mask, there are a lot of conversions to make.  If I
get  it  wrong,  the  only   error  message  is  “Types  are  not
compatible.”  As it happens, John’s particular  implementation of
the language in his compiler doesn’t tell you exactly <em>which</em> types
are not compatible … it only tells you which <em>line</em> the  error is
in.</p>
<p>I must admit that most of my errors with this compiler tend to be
errors of this type, and  I’ve  spent  a  lot  of  time  with the
Whimsical compiler, trying to figure out just <em>where</em>  in  the line
I’ve offended it.   The only real way to fix the error is to keep
trying things until something works.</p>
<p>So what should we do in TINY and KISS?  For the first one, I have
the answer:  TINY  will  support only the types <code>Char</code> and <code>Integer</code>,
and  we’ll  use  the  C  trick  of  promoting Chars  to  Integers
internally.  That means  that  the  TINY  compiler will be <em>much</em>
simpler  than  what  we’ve  already  done.    Type conversion  in
expressions is sort of moot, since none will be required!   Since
longwords will not be supported, we also won’t need the <code>MUL32</code> and
<code>DIV32</code> run-time routines, nor the logic to figure out when to call
them.  I <em>like</em> it!</p>
<p>KISS, on the other hand, will support the type Long.</p>
<p>Should it support both signed and unsigned arithmetic?    For the
sake of simplicity I’d rather not.    It  does add quite a bit to
the  complexity  of  type conversions.  Even  Niklaus  Wirth  has
eliminated  unsigned  (Cardinal) numbers from  his  new  language
Oberon, with the argument that  32-bit  integers  should  be long
enough for anybody, in either case.</p>
<p>But KISS is supposed to  be a systems programming language, which
means that we should  be  able to do whatever operations that can
be done in assembler.    Since the 68000 supports both flavors of
integers, I guess KISS  should,  also.    We’ve seen that logical
operations  need to be able to extend  integers  in  an  unsigned
fashion, so the unsigned conversion  procedures  are  required in
any case.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>That wraps up our session on type conversions.  Sorry you  had to
wait  so  long for it, but hope you feel that it  was  worth  the
wait.</p>
<p>In  the  next  few installments, we’ll extend the simple types to
include arrays and pointers, and we’ll have a look at what  to do
about  strings.    That should pretty well wrap up the mainstream
part of the series.  After  that,  I’ll give you the new versions
of the TINY and KISS compilers,  and  then we’ll start to look at
optimization issues.</p>
<p>See you then.</p>
