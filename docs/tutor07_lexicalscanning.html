<p>In the last installment, I left you with a  compiler  that  would
ALMOST  work,  except  that  we  were  still  limited to  single-
character tokens.  The purpose of  this  session is to get rid of
that restriction, once and for all.  This means that we must deal
with the concept of the lexical scanner.</p>
<p>Maybe I should mention why we  need  a lexical scanner at all ...
after all, we've been able to manage all right  without  one,  up
till now, even when we provided for multi-character tokens.</p>
<p>The ONLY reason, really, has to do with keywords.  It's a fact of
computer life that the syntax for a keyword has the same  form as
that  for  any  other identifier.  We can't tell until we get the
complete word whether or not it  IS  a keyword.  For example, the
variable IFILE and the keyword IF look just alike, until  you get
to the third character.  In the examples to date, we  were always
able to make  a  decision  based  upon the first character of the
token, but that's  no  longer possible when keywords are present.
We  need to know that a given string is a keyword BEFORE we begin
to process it.  And that's why we need a scanner.</p>
<p>In the last session, I also promised that  we  would  be  able to
provide for normal tokens  without  making  wholesale  changes to
what we have  already done.  I didn't lie ... we can, as you will
see later.  But every time I set out to install these elements of
the software into  the  parser  we  have already built, I had bad
feelings about it.  The whole thing felt entirely too much like a
band-aid.  I finally figured out what was causing the  problem: I
was installing lexical scanning software without first explaining
to you what scanning is all about, and what the alternatives are.
Up  till  now, I have studiously avoided  giving  you  a  lot  of
theory,  and  certainly  not  alternatives.    I  generally don't
respond well to the textbooks that give you twenty-five different
ways  to do something, but no clue as to which way best fits your
needs.  I've tried to avoid that pitfall by just showing  you ONE
method, that WORKS.</p>
<p>But  this is an important area.  While  the  lexical  scanner  is
hardly the most  exciting  part  of  a compiler, it often has the
most  profound  effect  on  the  general  &quot;look  &amp; feel&quot;  of  the
language, since after all it's the  part  closest to the user.  I
have a particular structure in mind for the scanner  to  be  used
with  KISS.    It fits the look &amp;  feel  that  I  want  for  that
language.  But it may not work at  all  for  the  language YOU'RE
cooking  up,  so  in this one case I feel that it's important for
you to know your options.</p>
<p>So I'm going to depart, again, from my  usual  format.    In this
session we'll be getting  much  deeper  than usual into the basic
theory of languages and  grammars.    I'll  also be talking about
areas OTHER than compilers in  which  lexical  scanning  plays an
important role.  Finally, I will show you  some  alternatives for
the structure of the lexical scanner.  Then, and only  then, will
we get back to our parser  from  the last installment.  Bear with
me ... I think you'll find it's worth the wait.    In fact, since
scanners have many applications  outside  of  compilers,  you may
well find this to be the most useful session for you.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lexical-scanning" id="lexical-scanning"><h1>LEXICAL SCANNING</h1></a>
<p>Lexical scanning is the process of scanning the  stream  of input
characters and separating it  into  strings  called tokens.  Most
compiler  texts  start  here,  and  devote  several  chapters  to
discussing various ways to build scanners.  This approach has its
place, but as you have already  seen,  there  is a lot you can do
without ever even addressing the issue, and in  fact  the scanner
we'll  end  up with here won't look  much  like  what  the  texts
describe.  The reason?    Compiler  theory and, consequently, the
programs resulting from it, must  deal with the most general kind
of parsing rules.  We don't.  In the real  world,  it is possible
to specify the language syntax in such a way that a pretty simple
scanner will suffice.  And as always, KISS is our motto.</p>
<p>Typically, lexical scanning is  done  in  a  separate part of the
compiler, so that the parser per  se  sees only a stream of input
tokens.  Now, theoretically it  is not necessary to separate this
function from the rest of the parser.  There is  only  one set of
syntax equations that define the  whole language, so in theory we
could write the whole parser in one module.</p>
<p>Why  the  separation?      The  answer  has  both  practical  and
theoretical bases.</p>
<p>In  1956,  Noam  Chomsky  defined  the  &quot;Chomsky   Hierarchy&quot;  of
grammars.  They are:</p>
<pre><code> - Type 0:  Unrestricted (e.g., English)
 - Type 1:  Context-Sensitive
 - Type 2:  Context-Free
 - Type 3:  Regular
</code></pre>
<p>A few features of the typical programming  language (particularly
the older ones, such as FORTRAN) are Type  1,  but  for  the most
part  all  modern  languages can be described using only the last
two types, and those are all we'll be dealing with here.</p>
<p>The  neat  part about these two types  is  that  there  are  very
specific ways to parse them.  It has been shown that  any regular
grammar can be parsed using a particular form of abstract machine
called the state machine (finite  automaton).    We  have already
implemented state machines in some of our recognizers.</p>
<p>Similarly, Type 2 (context-free) grammars  can  always  be parsed
using  a  push-down  automaton (a state machine  augmented  by  a
stack).  We have  also  implemented  these  machines.  Instead of
implementing  a literal stack, we have  relied  on  the  built-in
stack associated with recursive coding to do the job, and that in
fact is the preferred approach for top-down parsing.</p>
<p>Now, it happens that in  real, practical grammars, the parts that
qualify as  regular expressions tend to be the lower-level parts,
such as the definition of an identifier:</p>
<pre><code> `&lt;ident&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; [ &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; ]*`
</code></pre>
<p>Since it takes a different kind of abstract machine to  parse the
two  types  of  grammars, it makes sense to separate these lower-
level functions into  a  separate  module,  the  lexical scanner,
which is built around the idea of a state machine. The idea is to
use the simplest parsing technique needed for the job.</p>
<p>There is another, more practical  reason  for  separating scanner
from  parser.   We like to think of the input source  file  as  a
stream  of characters, which we process  right  to  left  without
backtracking.  In practice that  isn't  possible.    Almost every
language has certain keywords such as  IF,  WHILE, and END.  As I
mentioned  earlier,    we  can't  really  know  whether  a  given
character string is a keyword, until we've reached the end of it,
as defined by a space or other delimiter.  So  in  that sense, we
MUST  save  the  string long enough to find out whether we have a
keyword or not.  That's a limited form of backtracking.</p>
<p>So the structure of a conventional compiler involves splitting up
the functions of  the  lower-level and higher-level parsing.  The
lexical  scanner  deals  with  things  at  the  character  level,
collecting characters into strings, etc., and passing  them along
to the parser proper as indivisible tokens.  It's also considered
normal to let the scanner have the job of identifying keywords.</p>
<a class="header" href="#state-machines-and-alternatives" id="state-machines-and-alternatives"><h1>STATE MACHINES AND ALTERNATIVES</h1></a>
<p>I  mentioned  that  the regular expressions can be parsed using a
state machine.   In  most  compiler  texts,  and  indeed  in most
compilers as well, you will find this taken literally.   There is
typically  a  real  implementation  of  the  state  machine, with
integers used to define the current state, and a table of actions
to  take   for  each  combination  of  current  state  and  input
character.  If you  write  a compiler front end using the popular
Unix tools LEX and YACC, that's  what  you'll get.  The output of
LEX is a state machine implemented in C, plus a table  of actions
corresponding to the input grammar given to LEX.  The YACC output
is  similar  ...  a canned table-driven parser,  plus  the  table
corresponding to the language syntax.</p>
<p>That  is  not  the  only  choice,  though.     In   our  previous
installments, you have seen over and over that it is  possible to
implement  parsers  without  dealing  specifically  with  tables,
stacks, or state variables.    In fact, in Installment V I warned
you that if you  find  yourself needing these things you might be
doing something wrong, and not taking advantage of  the  power of
Pascal.  There are basically two ways to define a state machine's
state: explicitly, with  a  state number or code, and implicitly,
simply by virtue of the fact that I'm at a  certain  place in the
code  (if  it's  Tuesday,  this  must be Belgium).  We've  relied
heavily on the implicit approaches  before,  and  I  think you'll
find that they work well here, too.</p>
<p>In practice, it may not even be necessary to HAVE  a well-defined
lexical scanner.  This isn't our first experience at dealing with
multi-character tokens.   In  Installment  III,  we  extended our
parser to provide  for  them,  and  we didn't even NEED a lexical
scanner.    That  was  because  in that narrow context, we  could
always tell, just  by  looking at the single lookahead character,
whether  we  were  dealing  with  a  number,  a variable,  or  an
operator.  In effect, we  built  a  distributed  lexical scanner,
using procedures GetName and GetNum.</p>
<p>With keywords present,  we  can't know anymore what we're dealing
with, until the entire token is  read.    This leads us to a more
localized  scanner; although,  as you will see,  the  idea  of  a
distributed scanner still has its merits.</p>
<a class="header" href="#some-experiments-in-scanning" id="some-experiments-in-scanning"><h1>SOME EXPERIMENTS IN SCANNING</h1></a>
<p>Before  getting  back  to our compiler,  it  will  be  useful  to
experiment a bit with the general concepts.</p>
<p>Let's  begin with the two definitions most  often  seen  in  real
programming languages:</p>
<pre><code>     &lt;ident&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; [ &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; ]*
     &lt;number ::= [&lt;digit&gt;]+
</code></pre>
<p>(Remember, the '*' indicates zero or more occurences of the terms
in brackets, and the '+', one or more.)</p>
<p>We  have already dealt with similar  items  in  Installment  III.
Let's begin (as usual) with a bare cradle.  Not  surprisingly, we
are going to need a new recognizer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize an Alphanumeric Character }

function IsAlNum(c: char): boolean;
begin
   IsAlNum := IsAlpha(c) or IsDigit(c);
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Using this let's write the following two routines, which are very
similar to those we've used before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get an Identifier }

function GetName: string;
var x: string[8];
begin
   x := '';
   if not IsAlpha(Look) then Expected('Name');
   while IsAlNum(Look) do begin
     x := x + UpCase(Look);
     GetChar;
   end;
   GetName := x;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Number }

function GetNum: string;
var x: string[16];
begin
   x := '';
   if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected('Integer');
   while IsDigit(Look) do begin
     x := x + Look;
     GetChar;
   end;
   GetNum := x;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(Notice  that this version of GetNum returns  a  string,  not  an
integer as before.)</p>
<p>You  can  easily  verify that these routines work by calling them
from the main program, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">     WriteLn(GetName);
</code></pre>
<p>This  program  will  print any legal name typed in (maximum eight
characters, since that's what we told GetName).   It  will reject
anything else.</p>
<p>Test the other routine similarly.</p>
<a class="header" href="#white-space" id="white-space"><h1>WHITE SPACE</h1></a>
<p>We  also  have  dealt with embedded white space before, using the
two  routines  IsWhite  and  SkipWhite.    Make  sure that  these
routines are in your  current  version of the cradle, and add the
the line</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">     SkipWhite;
</code></pre>
<p>at the end of both GetName and GetNum.</p>
<p>Now, let's define the new procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Lexical Scanner }

Function Scan: string;
begin
   if IsAlpha(Look) then
      Scan := GetName
   else if IsDigit(Look) then
      Scan := GetNum
   else begin
      Scan := Look;
      GetChar;
   end;
   SkipWhite;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>We can call this from the new main program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }


begin
   Init;
   repeat
      Token := Scan;
      writeln(Token);
   until Token = CR;
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(You will have to add the declaration of the string Token  at the
beginning of the program.  Make it any convenient length,  say 16
characters.)</p>
<p>Now,  run the program.  Note how the  input  string  is,  indeed,
separated into distinct tokens.</p>
<a class="header" href="#state-machines" id="state-machines"><h1>STATE MACHINES</h1></a>
<p>For  the  record,  a  parse  routine  like  GetName  does  indeed
implement a state machine.  The state is implicit in  the current
position in the code.  A very useful trick for visualizing what's
going on is  the  syntax  diagram,  or  &quot;railroad-track&quot; diagram.
It's a little difficult to draw  one  in this medium, so I'll use
them very sparingly, but  the  figure  below  should give you the
idea:</p>
<pre><code>           |-----&gt; Other---------------------------&gt; Error
           |
   Start -------&gt; Letter ---------------&gt; Other -----&gt; Finish
           ^                        V
           |                        |
           |&lt;----- Letter &lt;---------|
           |                        |
           |&lt;----- Digit  &lt;----------
</code></pre>
<p>As  you  can  see,  this  diagram  shows  how  the logic flows as
characters  are  read.    Things  begin, of course, in the  start
state, and end when  a  character  other  than an alphanumeric is
found.  If  the  first  character  is not alpha, an error occurs.
Otherwise the machine will continue looping until the terminating
delimiter is found.</p>
<p>Note  that at any point in the flow,  our  position  is  entirely
dependent on the past  history  of the input characters.  At that
point, the action to be taken depends only on the  current state,
plus the current input character.  That's what make this  a state
machine.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of drawing  railroad-track  diagrams in
this medium, I'll continue to  stick to syntax equations from now
on.  But I highly recommend the diagrams to you for  anything you
do that involves parsing.  After a little practice you  can begin
to  see  how  to  write  a  parser  directly from  the  diagrams.
Parallel paths get coded into guarded actions (guarded by IF's or
CASE statements),  serial  paths  into  sequential  calls.   It's
almost like working from a schematic.</p>
<p>We didn't even discuss SkipWhite, which  was  introduced earlier,
but it also is a simple state machine, as is GetNum.  So is their
parent procedure, Scan.  Little machines make big machines.</p>
<p>The neat thing that I'd like  you  to note is how painlessly this
implicit approach creates these  state  machines.    I personally
prefer it a lot over the table-driven approach.  It  also results
is a small, tight, and fast scanner.</p>
<a class="header" href="#newlines" id="newlines"><h1>NEWLINES</h1></a>
<p>Moving right along, let's modify  our scanner to handle more than
one line.  As I mentioned last time, the most straightforward way
to  do  this  is to simply treat the newline characters, carriage
return  and line feed, as white space.  This is, in fact, the way
the  C  standard  library  routine,  iswhite, works.   We  didn't
actually try this  before.  I'd like to do it now, so you can get
a feel for the results.</p>
<p>To do this, simply modify the single executable  line  of IsWhite
to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">   IsWhite := c in [' ', TAB, CR, LF];
</code></pre>
<p>We need to give the main  program  a new stop condition, since it
will never see a CR.  Let's just use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">   until Token = '.';

</code></pre>
<p>OK, compile this  program  and  run  it.   Try a couple of lines,
terminated by the period.  I used:</p>
<pre><code> now is the time
 for all good men.
</code></pre>
<p>Hey,  what  happened?   When I tried it, I didn't  get  the  last
token, the period.  The program didn't halt.  What's more, when I
pressed the  'enter'  key  a  few  times,  I still didn't get the
period.</p>
<p>If you're still stuck in your program, you'll find that  typing a
period on a new line will terminate it.</p>
<p>What's going on here?  The answer is  that  we're  hanging  up in
SkipWhite.  A quick look at  that  routine will show that as long
as we're typing null lines, we're going to just continue to loop.
After SkipWhite encounters an LF,  it tries to execute a GetChar.
But since the input buffer is now empty, GetChar's read statement
insists  on  having  another  line.    Procedure  Scan  gets  the
terminating period, all right,  but  it  calls SkipWhite to clean
up, and SkipWhite won't return until it gets a non-null line.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior is not quite as bad as it seems.  In a real
compiler,  we'd  be  reading  from  an input file instead of  the
console, and as long  as  we have some procedure for dealing with
end-of-files, everything will come out  OK.  But for reading data
from the console, the behavior is just too bizarre.  The  fact of
the matter is that the C/Unix convention is  just  not compatible
with the structure of  our  parser,  which  calls for a lookahead
character.    The  code that the Bell  wizards  have  implemented
doesn't use that convention, which is why they need 'ungetc'.</p>
<p>OK, let's fix the problem.  To do that, we need to go back to the
old definition of IsWhite (delete the CR and  LF  characters) and
make  use  of  the procedure Fin that I introduced last time.  If
it's not in your current version of the cradle, put it there now.</p>
<p>Also, modify the main program to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }


begin
   Init;
   repeat
      Token := Scan;
      writeln(Token);
      if Token = CR then Fin;
   until Token = '.';
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Note the &quot;guard&quot;  test  preceding  the  call to Fin.  That's what
makes the whole thing work, and ensures that we don't try to read
a line ahead.</p>
<p>Try the code now. I think you'll like it better.</p>
<p>If you refer to the code  we  did in the last installment, you'll
find that I quietly sprinkled calls to Fin  throughout  the code,
wherever  a line break was appropriate.  This  is  one  of  those
areas that really affects the look  &amp;  feel that I mentioned.  At
this  point  I  would  urge  you  to  experiment  with  different
arrangements  and  see  how  you  like  them.    If you want your
language  to  be  truly  free-field,  then  newlines   should  be
transparent.   In  this  case,  the  best  approach is to put the
following lines at the BEGINNING of Scan:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">
          while Look = CR do
             Fin;
</code></pre>
<p>If, on the other  hand,  you  want  a line-oriented language like
Assembler, BASIC, or FORTRAN  (or  even  Ada...  note that it has
comments terminated by newlines),  then  you'll  need for Scan to
return CR's as tokens.  It  must  also  eat the trailing LF.  The
best way to do that is to use this line,  again  at the beginning
of Scan:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">          if Look = LF then Fin;
</code></pre>
<p>For other conventions, you'll  have  to  use  other arrangements.
In my example  of  the  last  session, I allowed newlines only at
specific places, so I was somewhere in the middle ground.  In the
rest of these sessions, I'll be picking ways  to  handle newlines
that I happen to like, but I want you to know how to choose other
ways for yourselves.</p>
<a class="header" href="#operators" id="operators"><h1>OPERATORS</h1></a>
<p>We  could  stop now and have a  pretty  useful  scanner  for  our
purposes.  In the fragments of KISS that we've built so  far, the
only tokens that have multiple characters are the identifiers and
numbers.    All  operators  were  single  characters.   The  only
exception I can think of is the relops &lt;=, &gt;=,  and  &lt;&gt;, but they
could be dealt with as special cases.</p>
<p>Still, other languages have  multi-character  operators,  such as
the ':=' of  Pascal or the '++' and '&gt;&gt;' of C.  So  while  we may
not need multi-character operators, it's  nice to know how to get
them if necessary.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we  can  handle operators very much the same way
as the other tokens.  Let's start with a recognizer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Recognize Any Operator }

function IsOp(c: char): boolean;
begin
   IsOp := c in ['+', '-', '*', '/', '&lt;', '&gt;', ':', '='];
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>It's important to  note  that  we  DON'T  have  to  include every
possible  operator in this list.   For  example,  the  paretheses
aren't  included, nor is the terminating  period.    The  current
version of Scan handles single-character operators  just  fine as
it is.  The list above includes only those  characters  that  can
appear in multi-character operators.  (For specific languages, of
course, the list can always be edited.)</p>
<p>Now, let's modify Scan to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Lexical Scanner }

Function Scan: string;
begin
   while Look = CR do
      Fin;
   if IsAlpha(Look) then
      Scan := GetName
   else if IsDigit(Look) then
      Scan := GetNum
   else if IsOp(Look) then
      Scan := GetOp
   else begin
      Scan := Look;
      GetChar;
   end;
   SkipWhite;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Try the program now.  You  will  find that any code fragments you
care  to throw at it will be neatly  broken  up  into  individual
tokens.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lists-commas-and-command-lines" id="lists-commas-and-command-lines"><h1>LISTS, COMMAS AND COMMAND LINES</h1></a>
<p>Before getting back to the main thrust of our study, I'd  like to
get on my soapbox for a moment.</p>
<p>How many times have you worked with a program or operating system
that had rigid rules about how you must separate items in a list?
(Try,  the  last  time  you  used MSDOS!)  Some programs  require
spaces as delimiters, and  some  require  commas.   Worst of all,
some  require  both,  in  different  places.    Most  are  pretty
unforgiving about violations of their rules.</p>
<p>I think this is inexcusable.  It's too  easy  to  write  a parser
that will handle  both  spaces  and  commas  in  a  flexible way.
Consider the following procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Skip Over a Comma }

procedure SkipComma;
begin
   SkipWhite;
   if Look = ',' then begin
      GetChar;
      SkipWhite;
   end;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>This eight-line procedure will skip over  a  delimiter consisting
of any number (including zero)  of spaces, with zero or one comma
embedded in the string.</p>
<p>TEMPORARILY, change the call to SkipWhite in Scan to  a  call  to
SkipComma,  and  try  inputting some lists.   Works  nicely,  eh?
Don't you wish more software authors knew about SkipComma?</p>
<p>For the record, I found that adding the  equivalent  of SkipComma
to my Z80 assembler-language programs took all of  6  (six) extra
bytes of  code.    Even  in a 64K machine, that's not a very high
price to pay for user-friendliness!</p>
<p>I  think  you can see where I'm going here.  Even  if  you  never
write a line of a compiler code in your life, there are places in
every program where  you  can  use  the concepts of parsing.  Any
program that processes a command line needs them.   In  fact,  if
you  think  about  it for a bit, you'll have to conclude that any
time  you  write  a program that processes  user  inputs,  you're
defining a  language.  People communicate with languages, and the
syntax implicit in your program  defines that language.  The real
question  is:  are  you  going  to  define  it  deliberately  and
explicitly, or just let it turn out to be  whatever  the  program
ends up parsing?</p>
<p>I claim that you'll have  a better, more user-friendly program if
you'll take the time to define the syntax explicitly.  Write down
the syntax equations or  draw  the  railroad-track  diagrams, and
code the parser using the techniques I've shown you here.  You'll
end  up with a better program, and it will be easier to write, to
boot.</p>
<a class="header" href="#getting-fancy" id="getting-fancy"><h1>GETTING FANCY</h1></a>
<p>OK, at this point we have a pretty nice lexical scanner that will
break  an  input stream up into tokens.  We could use  it  as  it
stands and have a servicable compiler.  But there are  some other
aspects of lexical scanning that we need to cover.</p>
<p>The main consideration is <code>&lt;shudder&gt;</code> efficiency.  Remember when we
were dealing  with  single-character  tokens,  every  test  was a
comparison of a single character, Look, with a byte constant.  We
also used the Case statement heavily.</p>
<p>With the multi-character tokens being returned by Scan, all those
tests now become string comparisons.  Much slower.  And  not only
slower, but more awkward, since  there is no string equivalent of
the  Case  statement  in Pascal.  It seems especially wasteful to
test for what used to be single characters ... the '=',  '+', and
other operators ... using string comparisons.</p>
<p>Using string comparison is not  impossible ... Ron Cain used just
that approach in writing Small C.  Since we're  sticking  to  the
KISS principle here, we would  be truly justified in settling for
this  approach.    But then I would have failed to tell you about
one of the key approaches used in &quot;real&quot; compilers.</p>
<p>You have to remember: the lexical scanner is going to be called a
<em>LOT</em>!   Once for every token in the  whole  source  program,  in
fact.   Experiments  have  indicated  that  the  average compiler
spends  anywhere  from 20% to 40% of  its  time  in  the  scanner
routines.  If there were ever a place  where  efficiency deserves
real consideration, this is it.</p>
<p>For this reason, most compiler writers ask the lexical scanner to
do  a  little  more work, by &quot;tokenizing&quot;  the input stream.  The
idea  is  to  match every token  against  a  list  of  acceptable
keywords  and operators, and return unique  codes  for  each  one
recognized.  In the case of ordinary variable  names  or numbers,
we  just return a code that says what kind of token they are, and
save the actual string somewhere else.</p>
<p>One  of the first things we're going to need is a way to identify
keywords.  We can always do  it  with successive IF tests, but it
surely would be nice  if  we  had  a general-purpose routine that
could compare a given string with  a  table of keywords.  (By the
way, we're also going  to  need such a routine later, for dealing
with symbol tables.)  This  usually presents a problem in Pascal,
because standard Pascal  doesn't  allow  for  arrays  of variable
lengths.   It's  a  real  bother  to  have to declare a different
search routine for every table.    Standard  Pascal  also doesn't
allow for initializing arrays, so you tend to see code like</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">     Table[1] := 'IF';
     Table[2] := 'ELSE';
     .
     .
     Table[n] := 'END';
</code></pre>
<p>which can get pretty old if there are many keywords.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Turbo Pascal 4.0 has extensions that  eliminate both
of  these  problems.   Constant arrays can be declared using TP's
&quot;typed constant&quot; facility, and  the  variable  dimensions  can be
handled with its C-like extensions for pointers.</p>
<p>First, modify your declarations like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Type Declarations  }

type Symbol = string[8];

     SymTab = array[1..1000] of Symbol;

     TabPtr = ^SymTab;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(The dimension  used  in  SymTab  is  not  real ... no storage is
allocated by the declaration itself,  and the number need only be
&quot;big enough.&quot;)</p>
<p>Now, just beneath those declarations, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Definition of Keywords and Token Types }

const KWlist: array [1..4] of Symbol =
              ('IF', 'ELSE', 'ENDIF', 'END');

{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, insert the following new function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Table Lookup }

{ If the input string matches a table entry, return the entry
  index.  If not, return a zero.  }
                             
function Lookup(T: TabPtr; s: string; n: integer): integer;
var i: integer;
    found: boolean;
begin
   found := false;
   i := n;
   while (i &gt; 0) and not found do
      if s = T^[i] then
         found := true
      else
         dec(i);
   Lookup := i;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>To test it,  you  can  temporarily  change  the  main  program as
follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }


begin
   ReadLn(Token);
   WriteLn(Lookup(Addr(KWList), Token, 4));
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how Lookup is called: The Addr function sets up  a pointer
to KWList, which gets passed to Lookup.</p>
<p>OK, give this  a  try.    Since we're bypassing Scan here, you'll
have to type the keywords in upper case to get any matches.</p>
<p>Now that we can recognize keywords, the next thing is  to arrange
to return codes for them.</p>
<p>So what kind of code should we return?  There are really only two
reasonable choices.  This seems like an ideal application for the
Pascal enumerated type.   For  example,  you can define something
like</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">     SymType = (IfSym, ElseSym, EndifSym, EndSym, Ident, Number,
                    Operator);
</code></pre>
<p>and arrange to return a variable of this type.   Let's  give it a
try.  Insert the line above into your type definitions.</p>
<p>Now, add the two variable declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">    Token: Symtype;          { Current Token  }
    Value: String[16];       { String Token of Look }
</code></pre>
<p>Modify the scanner to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Lexical Scanner }

procedure Scan;
var k: integer;
begin
   while Look = CR do
      Fin;
   if IsAlpha(Look) then begin
      Value := GetName;
      k := Lookup(Addr(KWlist), Value, 4);
      if k = 0 then
         Token := Ident
      else
         Token := SymType(k - 1);
      end
   else if IsDigit(Look) then begin
      Value := GetNum;
      Token := Number;
      end
   else if IsOp(Look) then begin
      Value := GetOp;
      Token := Operator;
      end
   else begin
      Value := Look;
      Token := Operator;
      GetChar;
   end;
   SkipWhite;
end;
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>(Notice that Scan is now a procedure, not a function.)</p>
<p>Finally, modify the main program to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Main Program }

begin
   Init;
   repeat
      Scan;
      case Token of
        Ident: write('Ident ');
        Number: Write('Number ');
        Operator: Write('Operator ');
        IfSym, ElseSym, EndifSym, EndSym: Write('Keyword ');
      end;
      Writeln(Value);
   until Token = EndSym;
end.
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
</code></pre>
<p>What we've done here is to replace the string Token  used earlier
with an enumerated type. Scan returns the type in variable Token,
and returns the string itself in the new variable Value.</p>
<p>OK, compile this and give it a whirl.  If everything  goes right,
you should see that we are now recognizing keywords.</p>
<p>What  we  have  now is working right, and it was easy to generate
from what  we  had  earlier.    However,  it still seems a little
&quot;busy&quot; to me.  We can  simplify  things a bit by letting GetName,
GetNum, GetOp, and Scan be  procedures  working  with  the global
variables Token and Value, thereby eliminating the  local copies.
It  also seems a little cleaner to move  the  table  lookup  into
GetName.  The new form for the four procedures is, then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get an Identifier }

procedure GetName;
var k: integer;
begin
   Value := '';
   if not IsAlpha(Look) then Expected('Name');
   while IsAlNum(Look) do begin
     Value := Value + UpCase(Look);
     GetChar;
   end;
   k := Lookup(Addr(KWlist), Value, 4);
   if k = 0 then
      Token := Ident
   else
      Token := SymType(k-1);
end;
                             
{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Number }

procedure GetNum;
begin
   Value := '';
   if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected('Integer');
   while IsDigit(Look) do begin
     Value := Value + Look;
     GetChar;
   end;
   Token := Number;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get an Operator }

procedure GetOp;
begin
   Value := '';
   if not IsOp(Look) then Expected('Operator');
   while IsOp(Look) do begin
     Value := Value + Look;
     GetChar;
   end;
   Token := Operator;
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Lexical Scanner }

procedure Scan;
var k: integer;
begin
   while Look = CR do
      Fin;
   if IsAlpha(Look) then
      GetName
   else if IsDigit(Look) then
      GetNum
   else if IsOp(Look) then
      GetOp
   else begin
      Value := Look;
      Token := Operator;
      GetChar;
   end;
   SkipWhite;
end;

<a class="header" href="#returning-a-character" id="returning-a-character"><h1>RETURNING A CHARACTER</h1></a>
<p>Essentially  every scanner I've ever seen  that  was  written  in
Pascal  used  the  mechanism of an enumerated type that I've just
described.  It is certainly  a workable mechanism, but it doesn't
seem the simplest approach to me.</p>
<p>For one thing, the  list  of possible symbol types can get pretty
long. Here, I've used just one symbol, &quot;Operator,&quot;  to  stand for
all of the operators, but I've seen other  designs  that actually
return different codes for each one.</p>
<p>There is, of course, another simple type that can be  returned as
a  code: the character.  Instead  of  returning  the  enumeration
value 'Operator' for a '+' sign, what's wrong with just returning
the character itself?  A character is just as good a variable for
encoding the different  token  types,  it  can  be  used  in case
statements  easily, and it's sure a lot easier  to  type.    What
could be simpler?</p>
<p>Besides, we've already  had  experience with the idea of encoding
keywords as single characters.  Our previous programs are already
written  that  way,  so  using  this approach will  minimize  the
changes to what we've already done.</p>
<p>Some of you may feel that this idea of returning  character codes
is too mickey-mouse.  I must  admit  it gets a little awkward for
multi-character operators like '&lt;='.   If you choose to stay with
the  enumerated  type,  fine.  For the rest, I'd like to show you
how to change what we've done above to support that approach.</p>
<p>First, you can delete the SymType declaration now ... we won't be
needing that.  And you can change the type of Token to char.</p>
<p>Next, to replace SymType, add the following constant string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">   const KWcode: string[5] = 'xilee';
</code></pre>
<p>(I'll be encoding all idents with the single character 'x'.)</p>
<p>Lastly, modify Scan and its relatives as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-delphi">{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get an Identifier }

procedure GetName;
begin
   Value := '';
   if not IsAlpha(Look) then Expected('Name');
   while IsAlNum(Look) do begin
     Value := Value + UpCase(Look);
     GetChar;
   end;
   Token := KWcode[Lookup(Addr(KWlist), Value, 4) + 1];
end;


{--------------------------------------------------------------}
{ Get a Number }

procedure GetNum;
begin
   Value := '';
   if not IsDigit(Look) then Expected('Integer');
   while IsDigit(Look) do begin
     Value := Value + Look;
     GetChar;

<p>This program should  work  the  same  as the previous version.  A
minor  difference  in  structure,  maybe,  but   it   seems  more
straightforward to me.</p>
<a class="header" href="#distributed-vs-centralized-scanners" id="distributed-vs-centralized-scanners"><h1>DISTRIBUTED vs CENTRALIZED SCANNERS</h1></a>
<p>The structure for the lexical scanner that I've just shown you is
very conventional, and  about  99% of all compilers use something
very  close  to it.  This is  not,  however,  the  only  possible
structure, or even always the best one.</p>
<p>The problem with the  conventional  approach  is that the scanner
has no knowledge of context.  For example,  it  can't distinguish
between the assignment operator '=' and  the  relational operator
'=' (perhaps that's why both C and Pascal  use  different strings
for the  two).    All  the scanner can do is to pass the operator
along  to  the  parser, which can hopefully tell from the context
which operator is meant.    Similarly, a keyword like 'IF' has no
place in the middle of a  math  expression, but if one happens to
appear there, the scanner  will  see no problem with it, and will
return it to the parser, properly encoded as an 'IF'.</p>
<p>With this  kind  of  approach,  we  are  not really using all the
information at our disposal.  In the middle of an expression, for
example, the parser  &quot;knows&quot;  that  there  is no need to look for
keywords,  but it has no way of telling the scanner that.  So the
scanner  continues to do so.  This, of  course,  slows  down  the
compilation.</p>
<p>In real-world compilers, the  designers  often  arrange  for more
information  to be passed between parser  and  scanner,  just  to
avoid  this  kind of problem.  But  that  can  get  awkward,  and
certainly destroys a lot of the modularity of the structure.</p>
<p>The  alternative  is  to seek some  way  to  use  the  contextual
information that comes from knowing where we are  in  the parser.
This leads us  back  to  the  notion of a distributed scanner, in
which various portions  of  the scanner are called depending upon
the context.</p>
<p>In KISS, as  in  most  languages,  keywords  ONLY  appear  at the
beginning of a statement.  In places like  expressions,  they are
not allowed.  Also, with one minor exception (the multi-character
relops)  that  is  easily  handled,  all  operators   are  single
characters, which means that we don't need GetOp at all.</p>
<p>So it turns out  that  even  with  multi-character tokens, we can
still always tell from the  current  lookahead  character exactly
what kind of token is coming,  except  at the very beginning of a
statement.</p>
<p>Even at that point, the ONLY  kind  of  token we can accept is an
identifier.  We need only to determine if that  identifier  is  a
keyword or the target of an assignment statement.</p>
<p>We end up, then, still needing only GetName and GetNum, which are
used very much as we've used them in earlier installments.</p>
<p>It may seem  at first to you that this is a step backwards, and a
rather  primitive  approach.   In fact, it is an improvement over
the classical scanner, since we're  using  the  scanning routines
only where they're really needed.  In places  where  keywords are
not allowed, we don't slow things down by looking for them.</p>
<a class="header" href="#merging-scanner-and-parser" id="merging-scanner-and-parser"><h1>MERGING SCANNER AND PARSER</h1></a>
<p>Now that we've covered  all  of the theory and general aspects of
lexical scanning that we'll be needing, I'm FINALLY ready to back
up my claim that  we  can  accomodate multi-character tokens with
minimal change to our previous work.  To keep  things  short  and
simple I will restrict myself here to a subset of what we've done
before; I'm allowing only one control construct (the  IF)  and no
Boolean expressions.  That's enough to demonstrate the parsing of
both keywords and expressions.  The extension to the full  set of
constructs should be  pretty  apparent  from  what  we've already
done.</p>
<p>All  the  elements  of  the  program to parse this subset,  using
single-character tokens, exist  already in our previous programs.
I built it by judicious copying of these files,  but  I  wouldn't
dare try to lead you through that process.  Instead, to avoid any
confusion, the whole program is shown below:</p>

<p>A couple of comments:</p>
<p>(1) The form for the expression parser,  using  FirstTerm, etc.,
is  a  little  different from what you've seen before.  It's
yet another variation on the same theme.  Don't let it throw
you ... the change is not required for what follows.</p>
<p>(2) Note that, as usual, I had to add calls to Fin  at strategic
spots to allow for multiple lines.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to adding the scanner, first copy this file and
verify that it does indeed  parse things correctly.  Don't forget
the &quot;codes&quot;: 'i' for IF, 'l' for ELSE, and 'e' for END or ENDIF.</p>
<p>If the program works, then let's press on.  In adding the scanner
modules to the program, it helps  to  have a systematic plan.  In
all  the  parsers  we've  written  to  date,  we've  stuck  to  a
convention that the current lookahead character should  always be
a non-blank character.  We  preload  the  lookahead  character in
Init, and keep the &quot;pump primed&quot;  after  that.  To keep the thing
working right at newlines, we had to modify this a bit  and treat
the newline as a legal token.</p>
<p>In the  multi-character version, the rule is similar: The current
lookahead character should always be left at the BEGINNING of the
next token, or at a newline.</p>
<p>The multi-character version is shown next.  To get it,  I've made
the following changes:</p>
<p>o Added the variables Token  and Value, and the type definitions
needed by Lookup.</p>
<p>o Added the definitions of KWList and KWcode.</p>
<p>o Added Lookup.</p>
<p>o Replaced GetName and GetNum by their multi-character versions.
(Note that the call  to  Lookup has been moved out of GetName,
so  that  it  will  not   be  executed  for  calls  within  an
expression.)</p>
<p>o Created a new,  vestigial  Scan that calls GetName, then scans
for keywords.</p>
<p>o Created  a  new  procedure,  MatchString,  that  looks  for  a
specific keyword.  Note that, unlike  Match,  MatchString does
NOT read the next keyword.</p>
<p>o Modified Block to call Scan.</p>
<p>o Changed the calls  to  Fin  a  bit.   Fin is now called within
GetName.</p>
<p>Here is the program in its entirety:</p>

<p>Compare this program with its  single-character  counterpart.   I
think you will agree that the differences are minor.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>At this point, you have learned how to parse  and  generate  code
for expressions,  Boolean  expressions,  and  control structures.
You have now learned how to develop lexical scanners, and  how to
incorporate their elements into a translator.  You have still not
seen ALL the elements combined into one program, but on the basis
of  what  we've  done before you should find it a straightforward
matter to extend our earlier programs to include scanners.</p>
<p>We are very  close  to  having  all  the elements that we need to
build a real, functional compiler.  There are still a  few things
missing, notably procedure  calls  and type definitions.  We will
deal with  those  in  the  next  few  sessions.  Before doing so,
however, I thought it  would  be fun to turn the translator above
into a true compiler.  That's what we'll  be  doing  in  the next
installment.</p>
<p>Up till now, we've taken  a rather bottom-up approach to parsing,
beginning with low-level constructs and working our way  up.   In
the next installment,  I'll  also  be  taking a look from the top
down,  and  we'll  discuss how the structure of the translator is
altered by changes in the language definition.</p>
<p>See you then.</p>
